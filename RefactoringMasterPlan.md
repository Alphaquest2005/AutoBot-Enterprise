# Refactoring Master Plan (Hub)

This document serves as the central hub for the Refactoring Master Plan. Detailed content for each section is maintained in separate sub-files, linked below. All modifications to this hub file or its sub-files are governed by the **RefactoringMasterPlan.md Management Protocol (RMP-MP)** and the **RMP Structure & File Management Protocol** detailed in `system-prompt-Logger`.

## 0. RMP Integrity Checklist
*(This section is TBD and will define a checklist for RMP content integrity, potentially in a separate `RMP_Integrity_Checklist.md` file or as an appendix here, as per RMP-MP Point 2 in `system-prompt-Logger`)*

## 1. Foundational LLM Directives
(Content defined in your primary system prompt: `system-prompt-Logger`)

## 2. User Objective Refinement (Current Iteration)
(See full content in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section2_UserObjective_Iter7.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section2_UserObjective_Iter7.md))
*This file should be updated each iteration with the new objective.*

## 3. Your Core Instrumentation Prompt (Roo - Logger Mode)
(See full content and sub-sections in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section3_CorePrompt_Hub.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section3_CorePrompt_Hub.md))
**(Note: Modifications to this Core Instrumentation Prompt are governed by the RMP Management Protocol detailed in `system-prompt-Logger`.)**

## 4. Your Plan (Current Iteration)
(See template/guidelines in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section4_Plan_Template.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section4_Plan_Template.md))
(See current iteration's detailed plan in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section4_Plan_Iter7.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section4_Plan_Iter7.md))
*The iteration-specific plan file should be created/updated each iteration.*

## 5. Log Analysis & Diagnosis (Current Iteration)
(See current iteration's analysis in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section5_LogAnalysis_Iter7.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section5_LogAnalysis_Iter7.md))
*This file should be populated during the iteration.*

## 6. Reflection & Prompt Improvements
(See current iteration's reflection in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section6_Reflection_Iter7.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section6_Reflection_Iter7.md))
(See standing improvement ideas in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section6_StandingImprovements.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section6_StandingImprovements.md))
*The iteration-specific reflection file should be created/updated at the end of each iteration.*

## 7. Escalation
(See current status and details in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section7_Escalation.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section7_Escalation.md))

## 8. Failure Tracking
(See failure log in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section8_FailureTracking.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section8_FailureTracking.md))
*This file is appended to as new failures occur.*

## 9. Scoring
(See current iteration's scoring in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section9_Scoring_Iter7.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section9_Scoring_Iter7.md))
*This file should be updated at the end of each iteration.*

## 10. Short-Term Memory (STM) Index
(See STM index in [`RMP_Modules/RMP_Section10_STM_Iter7.md`](./RMP_Modules/RMP_Section10_STM_Iter7.md))
*This file is appended to as new STM entries are created during reflection for the current iteration. A new file might be created for subsequent iterations or this could become a running log if STM IDs are globally unique.*
