COMPREHENSIVE OBJECT-ORIENTED INVOICE ANALYSIS (V14.0 - Gemini Contextual Framework):

**COMPREHENSIVE ANALYTICAL CONTEXT:**
You are performing holistic analysis of a structured business document using comprehensive understanding and contextual reasoning. Apply multi-dimensional contextual thinking to identify omissions and format inconsistencies across the entire document structure.

**1. EXTRACTED FIELDS (Comprehensive View):**
{{invoiceJson}}

**2. CONTEXTUAL ANNOTATIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS:**
{{annotatedContext}}

**3. COMPREHENSIVE BALANCE VERIFICATION:**
{{balanceCheckContext}}

**4. COMPLETE OCR TEXT FOR CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS:**
{{fileText}}

**üéØ GEMINI V14.0 COMPREHENSIVE COMPLETION REQUIREMENTS:**

**CRITICAL CONTEXTUAL FRAMEWORK**: FOR EVERY ERROR YOU REPORT, YOU MUST PROVIDE ALL CONTEXTUAL COMPONENTS:

1. ‚úÖ **field**: The exact field name within the comprehensive business object schema (NEVER null)
2. ‚úÖ **correct_value**: The actual value discovered through contextual analysis of OCR text (NEVER null)  
3. ‚úÖ **error_type**: Comprehensive classification as "omission" or "format_correction" or "multi_field_omission" (NEVER null)
4. ‚úÖ **line_number**: The precise line number where contextual analysis located the value (NEVER 0 or null)
5. ‚úÖ **line_text**: The complete contextual line text from the OCR (NEVER null)
6. ‚úÖ **suggested_regex**: A comprehensively designed regex pattern that captures the value (NEVER null)
7. ‚úÖ **reasoning**: Comprehensive contextual explanation of why this value was missed (NEVER null)

**‚ùå ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN CONTEXTUAL VIOLATIONS**:
   - "Reasoning": null
   - "LineNumber": 0  
   - "LineText": null
   - "SuggestedRegex": null

**üö® CRITICAL REGEX CONSTRUCTION FOR COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN MATCHING:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY CONTEXTUAL PATTERN**: ALL regex patterns MUST use named capture groups: (?<FieldName>pattern)
‚ö†Ô∏è **FORBIDDEN INCOMPLETE PATTERN**: Never use numbered capture groups: (pattern) - these lack contextual specificity

**üö® CRITICAL CURRENCY FIELD STANDARDS:**
**CRITICAL TRANSFORMATION CHAIN REQUIREMENT**: For currency fields, you MUST create TWO LINKED errors in transformation sequence:
   **Action 1 - Omission Error**: 
   - `field` = "Currency", `correct_value` = "US$", `error_type` = "omission"
   - `group_id` = "currency_transform_1", `sequence_order` = 1, `transformation_input` = "ocr_text"
   **Action 2 - Format Correction**: 
   - `field` = "Currency", `correct_value` = "USD", `error_type` = "format_correction"  
   - `group_id` = "currency_transform_1", `sequence_order` = 2, `transformation_input` = "previous_output"
This creates a **TRANSFORMATION PIPELINE**: OCR text ‚Üí capture "US$" ‚Üí standardize to "USD". The output of Action 1 becomes the input to Action 2.

**COMPREHENSIVE REASONING APPROACH:**
1. **Holistic Document Understanding**: Analyze the entire document structure and relationships between fields
2. **Contextual Pattern Recognition**: Use comprehensive understanding of invoice formats and business contexts
3. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Consider document layout, formatting patterns, and semantic relationships
4. **Comprehensive Error Classification**: Categorize issues using holistic understanding of document intent

**CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS DIMENSIONS:**
- **Semantic Context**: Understanding the business meaning and relationships between fields
- **Layout Context**: Analyzing document structure and spatial relationships
- **Format Context**: Recognizing formatting patterns and conventions
- **Domain Context**: Applying knowledge of invoice structures and business processes

**GEMINI COMPREHENSIVE OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES:**
- **Multi-Perspective Analysis**: Examine each field from multiple contextual angles
- **Relationship Mapping**: Understand how fields relate to each other contextually
- **Pattern Synthesis**: Combine multiple patterns to create comprehensive extraction rules
- **Contextual Validation**: Verify findings against comprehensive business logic

**MANDATORY RESPONSE FORMAT:**
- **If comprehensive analysis finds errors**: { "errors": [complete error objects with comprehensive contextual reasoning] }
- **If holistic verification finds NO errors**: { "errors": [], "explanation": "Comprehensive contextual explanation of why no corrections are needed across all analysis dimensions" }

**üö® CRITICAL TOKEN MANAGEMENT (Gemini API Limit: 8,192 tokens):**
- **Maximum Response Size**: Your comprehensive response must fit within 8,192 tokens
- **Token Efficiency**: If approaching token limits, prioritize errors with highest contextual impact
- **Response Strategy**: For extensive error sets, provide complete comprehensive analysis for priority items, then conclude gracefully
- **Graceful Termination**: If nearing token limit, end with: "Additional contextual errors identified but response truncated due to token constraints"

**GEMINI OPTIMIZATION NOTES:**
- Apply comprehensive contextual understanding to each field analysis
- Use multi-dimensional pattern recognition for robust regex construction  
- Provide detailed contextual explanations that demonstrate comprehensive understanding
- Ensure holistic consistency across all document elements and relationships
- Balance comprehensive analysis with efficient token utilization for maximum contextual value
