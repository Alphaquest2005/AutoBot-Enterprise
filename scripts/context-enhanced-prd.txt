# AutoBot-Enterprise OCR Enhancement PRD
## Generated using Augment Context Analysis

### Project Overview
Enhance the existing OCR correction system based on comprehensive codebase analysis.

### Current System Analysis (Context-Driven)

#### Existing Components Identified:
1. **OCRCorrectionRules Table**: Database-driven correction patterns
2. **ShipmentUtils.cs**: Correction orchestration with AttemptImportCorrection()
3. **EmailProcessor.cs**: Email processing workflow integration
4. **ImportIssueLog**: Detailed issue tracking and resolution logging
5. **OCRContext**: Entity Framework context for OCR operations

#### Current Correction Capabilities:
- Amazon: Missing shipping charges and tax amounts
- TEMU: Coupon deductions and shipping fees
- General: Currency parsing and number formatting

### Enhancement Requirements

#### 1. Expand Correction Rules (Priority: High)
- Add Shein-specific correction patterns
- Implement Alibaba invoice corrections
- Create dynamic rule learning system

#### 2. Improve Success Rate Tracking (Priority: Medium)
- Enhance SuccessCount/FailureCount metrics in OCRCorrectionRules
- Add detailed analytics dashboard
- Implement A/B testing for correction patterns

#### 3. Advanced Pattern Recognition (Priority: High)
- Machine learning-based pattern detection
- Context-aware field mapping
- Multi-language invoice support

#### 4. Integration Enhancements (Priority: Medium)
- Real-time correction feedback loop
- Automated rule generation from failed cases
- Enhanced logging and monitoring

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Changes:
- Extend OCRCorrectionRules with ML confidence scores
- Add new tables for pattern learning
- Enhance ImportIssueLog with correction analytics

#### Code Modifications:
- Extend ShipmentUtils correction methods
- Add new correction algorithms
- Integrate with existing EmailProcessor workflow

### Success Metrics
- Increase correction success rate from current baseline to 95%
- Reduce manual intervention by 80%
- Improve processing speed by 50%

### Dependencies
- Existing OCR infrastructure
- EmailProcessor workflow
- Database schema (OCRCorrectionRules, ImportIssueLog)
- ShipmentUtils correction framework
