      description: |
        Help us see what you saw. Give clear, numbered steps:

        1. Setup (OS, extension version, settings)
        2. Exact actions (clicks, input, files, commands)
        3. What happened after each step

        Think like you're writing a recipe. Without this, we can't reproduce the issue.
