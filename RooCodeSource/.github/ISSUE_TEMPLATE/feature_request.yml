        **Thank you for proposing a feature for Roo Code!**

        This template is for specific, actionable proposals following our [Issue-First Approach](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

        **Quality over speed:** We prefer detailed, clear proposals over quick ones. Vague proposals often get closed or require multiple rounds of clarification, which wastes everyone's time.

        **Before submitting:**
        - Search existing [Issues](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions) to avoid duplicates
        - For general ideas, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/categories/feature-requests) first, or use the #collaboration-board channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/roocode)
        - Join [Discord](https://discord.gg/roocode) and DM **Hannes Rudolph** (`hrudolph`) for guidance

        **Review process:** A maintainer (especially @hannesrudolph) will review this proposal. **Do not start implementation until approved and assigned.** We're a small team with limited resources, so every code addition needs careful consideration. We're always happy to receive clear, actionable proposals though!

        ## ❌ Common mistakes that lead to proposal rejection:
        - **Vague problem descriptions:** "UI is bad" -> Should be: "Submit button is invisible on dark theme"
        - **Solution without context:** "Add feature X" -> Should explain the problem first, then the solution
        - **Missing user impact:** "This would be cool" -> Should explain who benefits and how
        - **No acceptance criteria:** How do we know when it's done? What does success look like?

        If you're unsure how a good proposal should look like, you can check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/RooCodeInc/projects/1/views/1?query=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Aopen&filterQuery=is%3Aissue%2Copen%2Cclosed+label%3A%22feature+request%22+status%3A%22Issue+%5BUnassigned%5D%22%2C%22Issue+%5BIn+Progress%5D%22) where we have a list of all open feature requests that are ready to be implemented or currently being worked on.

  - type: textarea
    id: problem-description
    attributes:
      label: What specific problem does this solve?
      description: |
        **Be concrete and detailed.** Explain the problem from a user's perspective.

        ✅ **Good examples (specific, clear impact):**
        - "When running large tasks, users wait 5+ minutes because tasks execute sequentially instead of in parallel, blocking productivity"
        - "AI can only read one file per request, forcing users to make multiple requests for multi-file projects, increasing wait time from 30s to 5+ minutes"
        - "Dark theme users can't see the submit button because it uses white text on light grey background"

        ❌ **Poor examples (vague, unclear impact):**
        - "The UI looks weird" -> What specifically looks weird? On which screen? What's the impact?
        - "System prompt is not good" -> What's wrong with it? What behaviour does it cause? What should it do instead?
        - "Performance could be better" -> Where? How slow is it currently? What's the user impact?

        **Your problem description should answer:**
        - Who is affected? (all users, specific user types, etc.)
        - When does this happen? (specific scenarios/steps)
        - What's the current behaviour vs expected behaviour?
        - What's the impact? (time wasted, errors caused, etc.)
      placeholder: Be specific about the problem, who it affects, and the impact. Avoid generic statements like "it's slow" or "it's confusing."
    validations:
      required: true

  - type: textarea
    id: proposed-solution
    attributes:
      label: How should this be solved?
      description: |
        **Describe your solution in detail.** Explain not just what to build, but how it should work.

        ✅ **Good examples:**
        - "Add parallel task execution: Allow up to 3 tasks to run simultaneously with a queue system for additional tasks. Show progress for each active task in the UI."
        - "Enable multi-file AI processing: Modify the request handler to accept multiple files in a single request and process them together, reducing round trips."
        - "Fix button contrast: Change submit button to use primary colour on dark theme (white text on blue background) instead of current grey."

        ❌ **Poor examples:**
        - "Make it faster" -> How? What specific changes?
        - "Improve the UI" -> Which part? What specific improvements?
        - "Fix the prompt" -> What should the new prompt do differently?

        **Your solution should explain:**
        - What exactly will change?
        - How will users interact with it?
        - What will the new behaviour look like?
      placeholder: Describe the specific changes and how they will work. Include user interaction details if relevant.
    validations:
      required: true

    id: acceptance-criteria
    attributes:
      label: How will we know it works? (Acceptance Criteria)
      description: |
        **This is crucial - don't skip it.** Define what "working" looks like with specific, testable criteria.

        **Format suggestion:**
        ```
        Given [context/situation]
        When [user action]
        Then [expected result]
        And [additional expectations]
        But [what should NOT happen]
        ```

        **Example:**
        ```
        Given I have 5 large tasks to run
        When I start all of them
        Then they execute in parallel (max 3 at once, can be configured)
        And I see progress for each active task
        And queued tasks show "waiting" status
        But the UI doesn't freeze or become unresponsive
        ```
      placeholder: |
        Define specific, testable criteria. What should users be able to do? What should happen? What should NOT happen?
        Use the Given/When/Then format above or your own clear structure.
    validations:
      required: true

    id: estimated-effort
    attributes:
      label: Estimated effort and complexity
      description: |
        **Help us understand the scope.** This helps with planning and prioritisation.

        **Please include:**
        - **Size estimate:** XS/Small/Medium/Large/XL (or hours/days if you prefer)
        - **Reasoning:** What makes it this size? Which parts are complex?
        - **Main challenges:** What's the trickiest bit to implement?
        - **Dependencies:** Does this require other changes or external libraries?

        **Example:**
        ```
        Size: Large (2-3 weeks)
        Reasoning: Touches task execution engine, UI components, and state management
        Main challenges: Preventing memory leaks with parallel execution and managing shared resources
        Dependencies: Might need to add a new dependency for the new feature
        ```
      placeholder: |
        Size: [your estimate]
        Reasoning: [why this size?]
        Main challenges: [what's tricky?]
        Dependencies: [what else is needed?]
    validations:
      required: true
