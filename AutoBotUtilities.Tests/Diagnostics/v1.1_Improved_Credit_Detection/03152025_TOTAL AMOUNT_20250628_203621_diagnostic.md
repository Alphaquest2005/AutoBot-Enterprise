# Invoice Diagnostic Report - 03152025_TOTAL AMOUNT

## 📋 **File Identification**
- **Invoice File**: 03152025_TOTAL AMOUNT.txt
- **Test Version**: v1.1
- **Test Date**: 2025-06-28 20:36:21
- **Vendor Category**: Other
- **Issue Category**: DEEPSEEK_BALANCE_ERROR

## 🎯 **Issue Summary**
- **Primary Issue**: DEEPSEEK_BALANCE_ERROR
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Balance Error**: 13.7500
- **Total Issues Found**: 3

## 🏗️ **Design Challenge Context**
### **System Architecture**:
- **Dual-LLM Comparison**: Claude Code (JSON extraction) vs DeepSeek (error detection)
- **Caribbean Customs Rules**: TotalInsurance (negative customer reductions), TotalDeduction (positive supplier reductions)
- **OCR Section Precedence**: Single Column > Ripped Text > SparseText
- **Balance Formula**: SubTotal + TotalInternalFreight + TotalOtherCost + TotalInsurance - TotalDeduction = InvoiceTotal
- **Claude Model**: Claude 4 (Sonnet), temperature 0.1 via Claude Code SDK
- **DeepSeek Model**: deepseek-chat, temperature 0.3, max tokens 8192

### **🔄 Version Evolution (v1.0 → v1.1)**:
#### **v1.0 Analysis Results**:
- **Primary Issue Found**: False positive credit detection
- **Root Cause**: System flagged 'Credit Card transactions' as customer credit
- **Impact**: Payment method info mistaken for TotalInsurance mapping

#### **v1.1 Design Changes**:
- **Enhanced Credit Detection**: Distinguish actual credits from payment methods
- **Actual Credits**: 'Store Credit', 'Account Credit', 'Gift Card' → TotalInsurance
- **Payment Methods**: 'Credit Card transactions', 'Visa ending in' → EXCLUDED
- **Smart Pattern Matching**: Context-aware credit classification

#### **Expected v1.1 Behavior**:
- **Amazon File**: Should show NO_ISSUES_FOUND (false positive eliminated)
- **Baseline File**: Should maintain perfect performance
- **Future LLM Guidance**: Use this pattern for credit vs payment method distinction

## ❌ **Specific Issues Identified**

### **Issue 1: JSON Reference System Balance Error**
- **Problem**: JSON extraction produces balance error of 13.7500
- **Evidence**: Balance check: 13.7500 (should be 0.00)
- **Expected Behavior**: JSON reference should produce perfect balance (0.00)
- **Actual Behavior**: JSON reference has 13.7500 balance error
- **Proposed Fix**:
```
Review JSON extraction patterns and Caribbean Customs field mappings
```

### **Issue 2: DeepSeek AI Balance Error**
- **Problem**: DeepSeek detection produces balance error of 13.7500
- **Evidence**: Balance check: 13.7500 (should be 0.00)
- **Expected Behavior**: DeepSeek should produce perfect balance (0.00)
- **Actual Behavior**: DeepSeek has 13.7500 balance error
- **Proposed Fix**:
```
Enhance DeepSeek prompt with:
1. Better section precedence logic
2. Improved financial pattern detection
3. Balance validation in prompt
```

### **Issue 3: Mathematical Balance Check Failed**
- **Problem**: Invoice does not balance mathematically, indicating extraction errors
- **Evidence**: Production-format error objects:
[
  {
    "field": "CalculatedBalance",
    "extracted_value": "13.7500",
    "correct_value": "0.0000",
    "line_text": "",
    "line_number": 0,
    "confidence": 0.99,
    "error_type": "balance_error",
    "suggested_regex": "(?:Total|Grand Total).*\\\\$([\\\\d,]+\\\\.?\\\\d*)",
    "reasoning": "Mathematical balance check failed. Discrepancy: 13.7500. This indicates missing or incorrect financial field extraction."
  }
]
- **Expected Behavior**: Invoice should balance: SubTotal + Freight + OtherCost + Insurance - Deduction = InvoiceTotal
- **Actual Behavior**: Mathematical balance check failed
- **Proposed Fix**:
```
Review all financial field extractions using the error objects above
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps for LLM**
### **Immediate Actions Needed**:
- Implement prompt improvements
- Test affected files
- Verify balance accuracy

### **Success Criteria**:
- Balance error ≤ 0.01
- All fields detected correctly
- No regressions in other files

### **🎯 v1.1 Validation Results**:

## 📝 **Complete Prompt Versioning & Testing Protocol**

### **v1.1 Prompt Specifications**:

#### **JSON Extraction Prompt (Claude Code/DeepSeek Fallback) - JSON v1.1.0 + Detection v1.1.1**:
```
You are an expert invoice data extraction system that follows Caribbean Customs rules and production OCR section precedence logic. Extract all relevant invoice information from the provided OCR text and output a structured JSON object that matches the production ShipmentInvoice model.

**CARIBBEAN CUSTOMS FIELD MAPPING RULES:**

1. **TotalInsurance** = Customer-caused reductions (stored as NEGATIVE values):
   - Gift Cards → TotalInsurance = -amount  
   - Store Credits → TotalInsurance = -amount
   - Credits → TotalInsurance = -amount
   - Customer payments/refunds → TotalInsurance = -amount

2. **TotalDeduction** = Supplier-caused reductions (stored as POSITIVE values):
   - Free Shipping → TotalDeduction = +amount
   - Discounts → TotalDeduction = +amount  
   - Promotional reductions → TotalDeduction = +amount

**OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT JSON):**
{
  "invoiceHeader": {
    "InvoiceNo": "string or null",
    "InvoiceDate": "YYYY-MM-DD or null",
    "SupplierName": "string or null",
    "Currency": "USD/CNY/XCD or null"
  },
  "financialFields": {
    "InvoiceTotal": 0.00,
    "SubTotal": 0.00,
    "TotalInternalFreight": 0.00,
    "TotalOtherCost": 0.00,
    "TotalInsurance": 0.00,
    "TotalDeduction": 0.00
  },
  "calculatedValidation": {
    "calculatedTotal": 0.00,
    "balanceCheck": 0.00,
    "validationPassed": false
  },
  "confidence": "high/medium/low"
}

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
```

#### **Error Detection Logic (v1.1.1) - Enhanced Credit Pattern Recognition**:
```csharp
// v1.1 IMPROVED: Distinguish actual credits from payment methods
private bool HasActualCredit(string ocrText)
{
    var ocrLower = ocrText.ToLower();
    
    // Positive patterns - actual customer credits
    var actualCreditPatterns = new[]
    {
        "store credit", "account credit", "credit applied",
        "gift card", "refund amount", "credit balance"
    };
    
    var hasActualCredit = actualCreditPatterns.Any(pattern => ocrLower.Contains(pattern));
    
    // Negative patterns - payment methods (exclude these)
    var paymentMethodPatterns = new[]
    {
        "credit card transactions", "visa ending in", "payment method",
        "mastercard ending in", "amex ending in"
    };
    
    var isPaymentMethod = paymentMethodPatterns.Any(pattern => ocrLower.Contains(pattern));
    
    return hasActualCredit && !isPaymentMethod;
}
```

### **Testing Protocol Enhancement**:

#### **Mandatory Steps for All Future Diagnostic Versions**:
1. **Version Documentation**: Record exact prompt version used (v1.1.0, v1.1.1, etc.)
2. **Prompt Preservation**: Include complete prompt text in diagnostic file for reproducibility
3. **Historical Context**: Document what worked perfectly in previous versions
4. **Status Tracking**: Mark files as "PERFECT STATUS ACHIEVED" when no issues found
5. **Regression Prevention**: Explicitly state what should NOT change in future iterations
6. **LLM Guidance**: Provide explicit instructions for future LLM analysis

---
**Generated by**: Detailed Diagnostic Generator v1.1
**Prompt Version**: JSON v1.1.0 + Detection v1.1.1
**For LLM Context**: This file contains complete prompt versioning, historical resolution, and success state documentation.
**Protocol**: All future diagnostics must include prompt versions and historical success tracking.
**Foundation for v1.2**: Use this analysis to validate that improvements don't break working functionality.
