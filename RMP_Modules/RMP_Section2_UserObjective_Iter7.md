# 2. User Objective Refinement (Current Iteration)

## Current User-Defined Iteration Objective:
"initalize RMP for new user objective"

## Priority:
High

## Context and Background:
This is an initialization task to set up the Refactoring Master Plan (RMP) for a new iteration. The primary goal is to ensure all RMP files are correctly structured, linked, and ready for the next functional objective. This includes populating the Task Header and preparing the User Task Plan.

## Expected Outcome:
*   `RMP_Modules/RMP_Task_Header_Iter7.md` fully completed and verified.
*   `RMP_Modules/RMP_UserTask_Plan_Iter7.md` created with a placeholder or initial steps for the next functional objective.
*   All other iteration-specific RMP files (Sections 4, 5, 6, 9, 10) created as empty placeholders or with initial structure for Iteration 7.
*   `RefactoringMasterPlan.md` (hub) links updated to point to Iteration 7 files.

## Definition of Done for this Objective:
*   All items in `RMP_Modules/RMP_Task_Header_Iter7.md` are marked "Completed" or "Skipped/NA" with justification.
*   `RMP_Modules/RMP_UserTask_Plan_Iter7.md` exists and contains at least a basic structure for the next steps.
*   All other iteration-specific RMP files for Iteration 7 are present.
*   No errors or warnings related to RMP file structure or content.
