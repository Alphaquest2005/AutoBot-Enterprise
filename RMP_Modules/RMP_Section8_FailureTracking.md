## 8. Failure Tracking

*   **(Failures 7.1 - 7.12 from prior to Iteration 7 start. These will be candidates for LTM creation/summarization at end of Iteration 7, using task history.)**
*   **Failure 7.13 (Plan Step 4.13.16.4.1 - During Iteration 7):** The target test `CanImportAmazoncomOrder11291264431163432()` failed.
    *   **Type:** Test Failure
    *   **Description:** NUnit test `CanImportAmazoncomOrder11291264431163432()` in `AutoBotUtilities.Tests\PDFImportTests.cs` failed.
    *   **Details:** Assertion failed: "ShipmentInvoice '112-9126443-1163432' not created."
    *   **Diagnosis:** Initial log analysis (Section 5 sub-file) indicated failure in `HandleImportSuccessStateStep`. Code analysis of `HandleImportSuccessStateStep.Execute` suggests failure occurs if *any* template processing within the context fails.
    *   **Attempts:** 0 distinct attempts on the root cause fix yet. Currently in diagnosis phase.
    *   **Status:** Active - Under Diagnosis.
*   **Failure 7.14:**
    *   **Type:** Tool Execution Failure (`read_file`)
    *   **Description:** Attempted to read test log file `AutoBotUtilities.Tests\bin\x64\Debug\net48\logs\AutoBotUtilities.Tests-.log` (Plan Step 4.13.16.4.4.3) but file was not found.
    *   **Diagnosis:** The log file name was incorrect/not the most recent.
    *   **Resolution:** Identified correct log file path (`AutoBotUtilities.Tests\bin\x64\Debug\net48\Logs\AutoBotTests-20250517.log`) by listing directory contents. Updated plan and re-attempted read.
    *   **Status:** Resolved.
*   **Failure 7.15:**
    *   **Type:** Tool Execution Failure (`read_file`)
    *   **Description:** Attempted to read `RefactoringMasterPlan.md` (Plan Step 4.13.16.4.5.4) but the tool call repetition limit was reached.
    *   **Diagnosis:** System limitation on consecutive tool calls of the same type.
    *   **Resolution:** The system automatically allowed the tool call after the previous turn.
    *   **Status:** Resolved.
*   **(New failures from Iteration 7 execution will be added here.)**
*   **Failure 7.16:**
    *   **Type:** Tool Execution Failure (`read_file`)
    *   **Description:** Attempted to read `InvoiceProcessingContext.cs` at path `InvoiceReader/InvoiceReader/InvoiceProcessingContext.cs` but file was not found.
    *   **Diagnosis:** The specified file path is incorrect. The file likely exists in the `InvoiceReader` project but in a different subdirectory.
    *   **Resolution:** (To be determined - need to find the correct path).
    *   **Status:** Active - Under Diagnosis.
*   **Failure 7.17:**
    *   **Type:** Tool Execution Failure (`search_files`)
    *   **Description:** Attempted to search for `InvoiceProcessingContext.cs` within the `InvoiceReader` directory (`InvoiceReader`) but found 0 results.
    *   **Diagnosis:** The file is likely located outside the immediate `InvoiceReader` directory, possibly in a parent directory or a different project within the solution.
    *   **Resolution:** (To be determined - need to broaden the search).
    *   **Status:** Active - Under Diagnosis.
