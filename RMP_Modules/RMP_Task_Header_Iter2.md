| H1.1| `system-prompt-Logger` fully processed and all protocols (Hierarchical Task Management, RMP-MP, RMP Structure, Iteration Task Checklists, PSM-P, Task Execution Meta-Logging, Post-Build Mini-Review, Typed Logging System) understood.                                      | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 20:39:10 UTC              | 2025-05-21 20:39:10 UTC            | Confirmed understanding of all protocols.                         |
| H1.2| `RefactoringMasterPlan.md` (hub) and ALL active RMP sub-files (Sections 2-10 for current iteration) read and loaded into context. (As per Workflow Step -1.2.A, critical files like `ProjectStructure.md` must be verified/created).                                     | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 20:39:10 UTC              | 2025-05-21 20:39:10 UTC            | All RMP files for Iteration 2 loaded into context.                |

| H2  | **Protocol Adherence Confirmed:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Pending                                               |                                      |                                    |                                                                   |
| H2.1| Explicit confirmation of commitment to adhere to all protocols listed in H1.1 and the RMP Section 3 Core Prompt.                                                                                                                                                            | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 20:39:10 UTC              | 2025-05-21 20:39:10 UTC            | Confirmed adherence to all protocols.                             |
| H3  | **Critical System State Verification & Prerequisite Identification:**                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Pending                                               |                                      |                                    |                                                                   |
| H3.1| **`ProjectStructure.md` Status:** Verify `ProjectStructure.md` exists and meets all content requirements (as per new PSM-P Point 2). If not found, or incomplete/critically outdated for relevant modules, **its creation/update (following PSM-P) becomes a prerequisite task for the User Task Plan.** Note specific modules needing PSM-P update. | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 20:39:56 UTC              | 2025-05-21 20:39:56 UTC            | `ProjectStructure.md` exists and provides a comprehensive overview (last updated Iteration 7). No immediate update needed for current objective. |
| H3.2| **Logging System Filter Active:** Review Serilog config for the objective's primary execution path. **CRITICAL: The dynamic filter (using `LogFilterState`) MUST be implemented and active. This requires `Core.Common.Extensions.TypedLoggerExtensions.cs` and `Core.Common.Extensions.LogFilterState.cs` to exist and be correctly structured. If not, implementing/fixing them is a MANDATORY PREREQUISITE task (locating them via PSM-P, then analyzing/coding).** Document current state. | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 20:40:29 UTC              | 2025-05-21 20:40:29 UTC            | `TypedLoggerExtensions.cs` and `LogFilterState.cs` exist and are correctly structured, confirming the dynamic logging filter mechanism is in place. |
| H3.3| **Git Repository Status:** (Post-initial commit, if applicable) `git status` is clean or shows only expected untracked files. Address unexpected changes.                                                                                                                 | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 20:40:44 UTC              | 2025-05-21 20:40:44 UTC            | `git status` is clean, with only expected `imap-mcp` untracked content. |
| H3.4| **TDRP Applicability Review:** For current User Objective, assess if Test-Driven Refactoring Protocol (TDRP) is needed for key code areas due to complexity, size, or test coverage gaps. Note if TDRP steps must be part of User Task Plan.                                | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 20:41:26 UTC              | 2025-05-21 20:41:26 UTC            | TDRP is applicable as the objective is to fix a specific failing integration test. |
| H4  | **Initial Iteration Commit:** (If Workflow Step 3.0 defines this) Verified as completed. If not, execute as per RMP Workflow Step 3.0.                                                                                                                                    | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 20:39:10 UTC              | 2025-05-21 20:39:10 UTC            | Initial Git commit for Iteration 2 verified as completed.         |
| H5  | **Preliminary STM/LTM Review:** Brief, targeted Deliberate STM/LTM Review for keywords from User Objective completed. Insights, potential roadblocks, or reusable solutions noted for User Task Plan formulation.                                                           | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 20:41:47 UTC              | 2025-05-21 20:41:47 UTC            | Keywords: `ProcessEmailsAsync_ImportsPdfFromEmail_IntegrationTest`, `EmailDownloaderIntegrationTests.cs`, `pass`, `fail`, `PDF`, `email`, `import`, `integration test`. Potential roadblocks: email processing, PDF import, integration test environment setup. Reusable solutions: existing typed logging system. |
