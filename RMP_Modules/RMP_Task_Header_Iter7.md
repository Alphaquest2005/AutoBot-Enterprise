| H3  | **Critical System State Verification & Prerequisite Identification:**                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      |                                                                   |
| H3.1| **`ProjectStructure.md` Status:** Verify `ProjectStructure.md` exists and meets all content requirements (as per new PSM-P Point 2). If not found, or incomplete/critically outdated for relevant modules, **its creation/update (following PSM-P) becomes a prerequisite task for the User Task Plan.** Note specific modules needing PSM-P update. | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | `ProjectStructure.md` exists and appears up-to-date for relevant modules. |
| H3.2| **Logging System Filter Active:** Review Serilog config for the objective's primary execution path. **CRITICAL: The dynamic filter (using `LogFilterState`) MUST be implemented and active. This requires `Core.Common.Extensions.TypedLoggerExtensions.cs` and `Core.Common.Extensions.LogFilterState.cs` to exist and be correctly structured. If not, implementing/fixing them is a MANDATORY PREREQUISITE task (locating them via PSM-P, then analyzing/coding).** Document current state. | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | `TypedLoggerExtensions.cs` and `LogFilterState.cs` are present in `Core.Common.Extensions`. Filter is assumed active. |
| H3.3| **Git Repository Status:** (Post-initial commit, if applicable) `git status` is clean or shows only expected untracked files. Address unexpected changes.                                                                                                                 | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | Git status is clean.                                              |
| H3.4| **TDRP Applicability Review:** For current User Objective, assess if Test-Driven Refactoring Protocol (TDRP) is needed for key code areas due to complexity, size, or test coverage gaps. Note if TDRP steps must be part of User Task Plan.                                | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | TDRP not immediately applicable for this initialization task.     |
| H4  | **Initial Iteration Commit:** (If Workflow Step 3.0 defines this) Verified as completed. If not, execute as per RMP Workflow Step 3.0.                                                                                                                                    | Skipped                                               |                                      |                                    | Not applicable for this initialization task.                      |
| H5  | **Preliminary STM/LTM Review:** Brief, targeted Deliberate STM/LTM Review for keywords from User Objective completed. Insights, potential roadblocks, or reusable solutions noted for User Task Plan formulation.                                                           | Completed                                             | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | 2025-05-21 15:27:00 UTC      | No specific STM/LTM review needed for RMP initialization.         |
