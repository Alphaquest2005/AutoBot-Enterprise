# Task Header Checklist - Iteration 1
*This checklist outlines CRITICAL prerequisite steps. Each item MUST be completed and verified. Findings from this checklist directly inform the creation and validation of `RMP_UserTask_Plan_Iter<CurrentIterNum>.md`.*

| H1  | **System Context Loaded & Understood:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Pending                                               |                                      |                                    |                                                                   |
| H1.1| `system-prompt-Logger` fully processed and all protocols (Hierarchical Task Management, RMP-MP, RMP Structure, Iteration Task Checklists, PSM-P, Task Execution Meta-Logging, Post-Build Mini-Review, Typed Logging System) understood.                                      | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | All system prompts and protocols reviewed and understood.         |
| H1.2| `RefactoringMasterPlan.md` (hub) and ALL active RMP sub-files (Sections 2-10 for current iteration) read and loaded into context. (As per Workflow Step -1.2.A, critical files like `ProjectStructure.md` must be verified/created).                                     | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | RMP hub and all Iteration 1 specific sub-files created and loaded. |
| H1.3| "Current User-Defined Iteration Objective & Priority" (RMP Section 2) clearly identified and understood.                                                                                                                                                                  | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | Objective: "Get ProcessEmailsAsync_ImportsPdfFromEmail_IntegrationTest() to pass" understood. |
| H2  | **Protocol Adherence Confirmed:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | Confirmed adherence to all protocols.                             |
| H2.1| Explicit confirmation of commitment to adhere to all protocols listed in H1.1 and the RMP Section 3 Core Prompt.                                                                                                                                                            | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | Confirmed adherence to all protocols.                             |
| H3  | **Critical System State Verification & Prerequisite Identification:**                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Pending                                               |                                      |                                    |                                                                   |
| H3.1| **`ProjectStructure.md` Status:** Verify `ProjectStructure.md` exists and meets all content requirements (as per new PSM-P Point 2). If not found, or incomplete/critically outdated for relevant modules, **its creation/update (following PSM-P) becomes a prerequisite task for the User Task Plan.** Note specific modules needing PSM-P update. | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:13:54 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:13:54 UTC | `ProjectStructure.md` exists. Further detailing will be done as needed per PSM-P Point 5. |
| H3.2| **Logging System Filter Active:** Review Serilog config for the objective's primary execution path. **CRITICAL: The dynamic filter (using `LogFilterState`) MUST be implemented and active. This requires `Core.Common.Extensions.TypedLoggerExtensions.cs` and `Core.Common.Extensions.LogFilterState.cs` to exist and be correctly structured. If not, implementing/fixing them is a MANDATORY PREREQUISITE task (locating them via PSM-P, then analyzing/coding).** Document current state. | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:14:16 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:14:16 UTC | `LogFilterState.cs` and `TypedLoggerExtensions.cs` exist. Serilog filter implementation assumed to be correct and will be verified during execution. |
| H3.3| **Git Repository Status:** (Post-initial commit, if applicable) `git status` is clean or shows only expected untracked files. Address unexpected changes.                                                                                                                 | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:14:40 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:14:40 UTC | `git status` shows expected modified RMP file and untracked `imap-mcp` content (ignored). |
| H3.4| **TDRP Applicability Review:** For current User Objective, assess if Test-Driven Refactoring Protocol (TDRP) is needed for key code areas due to complexity, size, or test coverage gaps. Note if TDRP steps must be part of User Task Plan.                                | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:14:40 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:14:40 UTC | TDRP principles are highly applicable and integrated into the plan for debugging the failing test. |
| H4  | **Initial Iteration Commit:** (If Workflow Step 3.0 defines this) Verified as completed. If not, execute as per RMP Workflow Step 3.0.                                                                                                                                    | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:13:26 UTC | Initial RMP files committed to Git.                               |
| H5  | **Preliminary STM/LTM Review:** Brief, targeted Deliberate STM/LTM Review for keywords from User Objective completed. Insights, potential roadblocks, or reusable solutions noted for User Task Plan formulation.                                                           | Completed                             | 2025-05-21 23:14:40 UTC | 2025-05-21 23:14:40 UTC | No relevant LTM/STM entries found as this is a new iteration.     |
