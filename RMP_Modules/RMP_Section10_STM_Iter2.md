# Short-Term Memory (STM) Index - Iteration 2

This file serves as the Short-Term Memory (STM) index for Iteration 2. It lists immutable entries that provide "seeds" for deterministic construction of Long-Term Memory (LTM) filenames.

## STM Entries

*(To be populated during the iteration, especially during reflection)*
