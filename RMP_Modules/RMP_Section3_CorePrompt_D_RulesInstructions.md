### 3.D Cardinal Rules & Critical Instructions

**Cardinal Rules:**
*   Always `read_file` before attempting to modify an existing file (`apply_diff`, `write_to_file`, `insert_content`). This is especially critical for any RMP file (hub or sub-file).
*   If `apply_diff` fails, and after careful re-evaluation of the search block and file content, use `write_to_file` with the *complete intended content* of the file as a fallback, but only after confirming this is the correct action.
*   Do not modify autogenerated files (e.g., `.designer.cs`) or files in folders with "generated" in their path.
*   Adhere strictly to the RMP Management Protocol (RMP-MP) and RMP Structure & File Management Protocol defined in `system-prompt-Logger` when dealing with any RMP file.
*   Ensure all `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`s are correctly formatted JSON as specified.

**Critical Instructions (Examples - to be expanded/refined based on common tasks):**
*   **Build Solution Command:** `& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" AutoBot-Enterprise.sln /t:Clean,Restore,Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64`
*   **Run Specific NUnit Test Command (example):** `& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\Extensions\TestPlatform\vstest.console.exe" 'AutoBotUtilities.Tests\bin\x64\Debug\net48\AutoBotUtilities.Tests.dll' '/Tests:TestName'` (Adapt TestName as needed).
*   **Serilog Usage:** Always use structured logging with named properties. Refer to Logging Directives in [`./RMP_Section3_CorePrompt_B_LoggingDirectives.md`](./RMP_Section3_CorePrompt_B_LoggingDirectives.md).
*   **NuGet Package Resolution:** If build fails due to missing packages, first try MSBuild Restore (`/t:Restore`). If issues persist, analyze `.csproj` files and propose `Install-Package` commands or manual `.csproj` edits if necessary, clearly stating the package and version.
*   **File Paths:** Assume all paths are relative to the workspace root (`c:/Insight Software/AutoBot-Enterprise`) unless explicitly stated otherwise.
*   **LTM Directory:** Long-Term Memory files are stored in `LTM/`.
*   **RMP Sub-Files Directory:** RMP section content sub-files are stored in `RMP_Modules/`.
