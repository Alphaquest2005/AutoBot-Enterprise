## 4. Your Plan (Iteration 7)

**Objective:** Make the `CanImportAmazoncomOrder11291264431163432()` test in `AutoBotUtilities.Tests\PDFImportTests.cs` pass. Establish LTM/STM framework with reactive consultation and integrate task history analysis into reflection.

**Current Status:** PRE-ITERATION SETUP (Workflow Step 3.1.0) is complete, including updating ProjectStructure.md and resolving file locations. The LTM/STM framework and task history integration are operational. The focus is now on diagnosing the cause of Failure 7.13 (Test failure). Encountered and resolved Failure 7.14 (File not found) and Failure 7.15 (Tool repetition limit). Log analysis (4.13.16.4.4.5) and initial hypothesis (4.13.16.4.5) are complete. Code analysis of `HandleImportSuccessStateStep.cs` (4.13.16.4.6.5) is complete.

**Plan Steps:**
*   4.1 - 4.13.16.4.6.5 (Completed steps from previous execution leading to Failure 7.13 diagnosis and initial code analysis. These will be reviewed at the end of Iteration 7 for potential LTM/STM entry creation and summarization in this plan, using task history if provided.)
*   **Diagnosing Failure 7.13: Test `CanImportAmazoncomOrder11291264431163432()` failed.**
    *   **Refined Hypothesis (based on code analysis 4.13.16.4.6.5):** `HandleImportSuccessStateStep` returns `False` if *any* template processing fails within the loop, even if others succeed. The failure for order `112-9126443-1163432` likely occurred because the processing of *another template* within the same `InvoiceProcessingContext` failed, causing `overallStepSuccess` to be set to `false`.
    *   **Verify Hypothesis & Pinpoint Root Cause (Detailed Log Analysis):**
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.1: **Formulate `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`** Type: `PlanStepExecution_Intent`, Content: "Re-read the test log file `AutoBotUtilities.Tests\\bin\\x64\\Debug\\net48\\Logs\\AutoBotTests-20250517.log` for detailed analysis of `HandleImportSuccessStateStep` execution across all templates."
            *   **(Internal: Execute Reactive STM/LTM Consultation Sub-Workflow).**
            *   Output `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.2: Use `read_file` with `path: AutoBotUtilities.Tests\bin\x64\Debug\net48\Logs\AutoBotTests-20250517.log`.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.3: **Formulate `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`** Type: `PlanStepExecution_Outcome`, Content: "Successfully re-read test log file. Proceeding with detailed analysis." (Or error).
            *   **(Internal: Execute Reactive STM/LTM Consultation Sub-Workflow).**
            *   Output `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`.
        *   ~~4.13.16.4.6.9.4: Analyze the log content to identify all templates processed by `HandleImportSuccessStateStep` for the relevant file path and trace their individual outcomes. Document findings in Section 5 sub-file.~~ **Blocked by Failure 7.18 (Missing log files).**
            *   ~~**(Each analytical finding here is conceptually a `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE` and triggers reactive LTM consultation.)**~~
    *   **Diagnosing Failure 7.18: Missing Log Files**
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.5: **Formulate `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`** Type: `PlanStepExecution_Intent`, Content: "Verifying test execution and Serilog configuration in AutoBotUtilities.Tests."
            *   **(Internal: Execute Reactive STM/LTM Consultation Sub-Workflow).**
            *   Output `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.6: Read `AutoBotUtilities.Tests\PDFImportTests.cs` to examine the `OneTimeSetUp` method and test execution logic for potential issues preventing logger initialization or test execution.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.7: Analyze the code for Serilog configuration details, specifically how the logger is initialized and the file sink is configured.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.8: **Formulate `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`** Type: `PlanStepExecution_Outcome`, Content: "Code analysis of test setup and logging configuration complete." (Or error).
            *   **(Internal: Execute Reactive STM/LTM Consultation Sub-Workflow).**
            *   Output `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.9: Based on analysis, identify potential reasons for missing log files (e.g., logger not initialized, incorrect path in configuration, tests not actually running). Document findings in Section 5 sub-file.
            *   **(Each analytical finding here is conceptually a `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE` and triggers reactive LTM consultation.)**
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.10: If a configuration issue is identified, formulate a fix.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.11: Update "Your Plan" (this RMP Section 4 sub-file) with specific steps to implement the formulated fix for the logging issue.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.12: Implement the fix using `apply_diff` or `write_to_file`.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.13: **Formulate `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`** Type: `PlanStepExecution_Intent`, Content: "Rebuilding solution and running test to generate new log file."
            *   **(Internal: Execute Reactive STM/LTM Consultation Sub-Workflow).**
            *   Output `META_LOG_DIRECTIVE`.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.9.14: Proceed to **Workflow Step 3.4: BUILD/TEST/FIX LOOP** (specifically, build the solution and run the test `CanImportAmazoncomOrder11291264431163432()`).
    *   **Formulate & Implement Fix (Original steps, now dependent on new log analysis):**
        *   4.13.16.4.6.10.1: Based on the detailed log analysis of the *newly generated* log file, identify the root cause of the failure for the specific template(s) that caused `overallStepSuccess` to be false.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.10.2: Formulate the fix. (Based on previous analysis, the most likely fix is to modify `HandleImportSuccessStateStep.Execute` to only consider the success/failure of templates that were actually identified as matching the document). This may involve examining `InvoiceProcessingContext.cs` to see how identified templates are stored.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.10.3: Update "Your Plan" (this RMP Section 4 sub-file) with specific steps to implement the formulated fix.
        *   4.13.16.4.6.10.4: Implement the fix using `apply_diff` or `write_to_file`.
    *   **Verify Fix:**
        *   4.13.16.4.7: Proceed to **Workflow Step 3.4: BUILD/TEST/FIX LOOP** (specifically, build and run the test `CanImportAmazoncomOrder11291264431163432()`).
        *   4.13.16.4.8: If test `CanImportAmazoncomOrder11291264431163432()` now passes, proceed to **Workflow Step 3.4.5: REQUEST & RETRIEVE TASK HISTORY**.
        *   4.13.16.4.9: If test still fails, re-evaluate, potentially update hypothesis/sub-plan, or consider if 3 distinct attempts have been made on this specific aspect of the failure. If so, and still blocked, proceed to **Workflow Step 3.1.5: INITIATE ESCALATE PROTOCOL**. Otherwise, loop back to a refined version of 4.13.16.4.6 or 4.13.16.4.7.
*   **LTM/STM and Reflection:**
    *   4.14: Request Task History (Workflow Step 3.4.5).
    *   4.15: Reflect and Self-Improve (Workflow Step 3.5), including LTM/STM updates and prompt improvements.
    *   4.16: Attempt Completion (Workflow Step 3.6).
