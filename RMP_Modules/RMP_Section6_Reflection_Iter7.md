# 6. Reflection & Prompt Improvements (Current Iteration 7)

## Iteration Objective: "initialize RMP for new user objective"

### 6.1. Overall Iteration Summary:
(Summarize the iteration's progress, key challenges, and successes.)

### 6.2. Performance Analysis:
*   **Adherence to Plan:** (How well was the plan followed? Any deviations and why?)
*   **Efficiency:** (Was the iteration efficient? Any bottlenecks or areas for improvement?)
*   **Accuracy:** (Were the changes accurate and effective?)

### 6.3. Learnings & Insights:
*   **Technical Learnings:** (New technical knowledge gained, e.g., about the codebase, tools, or patterns.)
*   **Process Learnings:** (Insights into the effectiveness of the RMP, protocols, or workflow.)
*   **Unexpected Discoveries:** (Any surprising findings or issues encountered.)

### 6.4. Failure Analysis (if applicable):
(If any failures occurred, analyze their root causes and how they were addressed.)

### 6.5. Proposed Improvements to Core Instrumentation Prompt (RMP Section 3) & System Protocols:
(Based on the reflection, propose concrete, actionable improvements to your own guiding instructions or the system protocols. This is where self-improvement happens.)

### 6.6. LTM/STM Candidates:
(Identify key learnings or patterns that should be formalized into new LTM entries or indexed in STM.)
