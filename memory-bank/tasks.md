# Tasks
[2025-05-03 16:47:47] - ## Task: Setup Advanced Memory Bank

**Complexity Level:** 2 (Simple Enhancement)

**Description:** Setup the memory bank from https://github.com/enescingoz/roo-advanced-memory-bank. Involves cloning, configuring modes, and initializing the VAN workflow.

[2025-05-03 16:53:31] - ## Implementation Plan (Level 2)
- [x] Clone `advanced-memory-bank` repository.
- [x] Move `.roomodes` to workspace root.
- [x] Update paths within `.roomodes`.
- [x] Switch to VAN mode.
- [x] Run VAN initialization (create `tasks.md`, determine complexity).
- [x] Switch to PLAN mode.
- [x] Perform Technology Validation (verify modes load, essential files exist).
- [x] Update `tasks.md` with final status.
- [x] Verify plan completeness.

## Technology Validation
- **Stack:** Roo Code custom modes (`.roomodes`), rule files (`advanced-memory-bank/.roo/rules/`).
- **Validation:**
  - [x] Custom modes (VAN, PLAN) load successfully.
  - [x] Essential files (`.roomodes`, `tasks.md`) exist in correct locations.
  - [x] Core rule files appear present (though specific Level 2 files were missing).
  - [x] Technology validation complete.

## Status
- [x] Initialization complete (VAN)
- [x] Planning complete (PLAN)
- [x] Technology validation complete (PLAN)
- [x] Implementation complete (Setup task finished)

## Challenges & Mitigations
- **Challenge:** Missing Level 2 rule files (`enhancement-planning.mdc`, `task-tracking-basic.mdc`).
  - **Mitigation:** Followed general Level 2 steps from `plan-mode-map.mdc` and adapted.
- **Challenge:** `.roomodes` file initially in subdirectory.
  - **Mitigation:** Moved file to root and updated internal paths.

[2025-05-05 08:49:31] - ## New Task: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis (autobot1/autobot)

**Request:** Execute a comprehensive analysis of the `autobot1\autobot` project codebase. The analysis must encompass the primary project and identify/include all directly related sub-projects, libraries, and data stores referenced within its configuration files or build scripts. Thoroughly examine the project's architecture, key functionalities, component interactions, data processing pipelines, dependencies (internal and external), and technology stack. Synthesize these findings into a structured summary document suitable for a knowledge base. This summary must explicitly detail: high-level architecture, core modules/components and their responsibilities, key data structures/schemas, critical execution flows/algorithms, mapping of functionalities to code locations, a list of identified technologies/frameworks/libraries with versions, location/purpose of configuration files, and external service dependencies. This summary will provide actionable context to enhance logging systems with component information, validate file/resource path accuracy, maintain an up-to-date technology inventory, improve project documentation, and refactor the project to follow SOLID principles.

[2025-05-05 13:31:30] - ## Task Update: Scope Broadened to Full Workspace Analysis

**Reason:** Initial target directory `autobot1/autobot` not found. User requested a full workspace scan (file listing and definition summary) to build comprehensive context before proceeding with detailed analysis and refactoring.

[2025-05-05 16:54:48] - ## New Task: Create TEMU Invoice Import SQL Entries

**Request:** Based on the memory bank, create a plan for database entries required to import TEMU invoices into the `WebSource-AutoBot` database. Analyze existing invoice import mechanisms (e.g., Amazon) and the database schema (`Actions`, `FileTypes`, `EmailInfoMappings`, `InfoMapping`, `InfoMappingRegEx`, etc.) to determine the necessary SQL `INSERT` statements. Use `AutoBotUtilities.Tests\PDFUtilsTests.cs::CanImportTemuInvoice_07252024_TEMU()` for verification. Add learnings to the memory bank.

**Complexity Level:** 3 (Moderate Complexity)

[2025-05-05 17:06:09] - ## Implementation Plan: TEMU Invoice Import (Level 3)

**Requirements Analysis:**
- Core Requirements:
  - [ ] Create a mechanism to import TEMU PDF invoices.
  - [ ] Extract key header fields (e.g., InvoiceNo, Date, Total) and line item details (e.g., Item Description, Quantity, Price) from TEMU PDFs.
  - [ ] Store extracted data in the `WebSource-AutoBot` database (`ShipmentInvoice`, `ShipmentInvoiceDetails` tables).
  - [ ] Utilize the existing `InvoiceReader` framework by defining a new OCR template in the `OCR` database.
  - [ ] Ensure import works for sample TEMU PDFs from tests.
  - [ ] Verify results using `CanImportTemuInvoice_07252024_TEMU` test.
- Technical Constraints:
  - [ ] Must integrate with the existing `PDFUtils` -> `InvoiceReader` flow.
  - [ ] Requires access to and ability to modify the `OCR` database (separate from `WebSource-AutoBot`).

**Component Analysis:**
- **`OCR` Database:**
  - Changes needed: Add new rows to `Invoices`, `Parts`, `Lines`, `Fields`, `RegularExpressions`, `InvoiceIdentificatonRegEx` tables for TEMU template.
  - Dependencies: Schema understanding, example regex from other templates.
- **`WebSource-AutoBot` Database:**
  - Changes needed: Verify `FileType` ID 1147 configuration. No schema changes expected.
  - Dependencies: `FileType` 1147 exists and triggers the correct action.
- **`InvoiceReader` Code (`WaterNut.Business.Services/.../InvoiceReader.cs`):**
  - Changes needed: None anticipated initially.
  - Dependencies: `PdfPig`, Tesseract (`PdfOcr`).
- **`PDFUtils` Code (`AutoBot/PDFUtils.cs`):**
  - Changes needed: None anticipated.
  - Dependencies: Calls `InvoiceReader`.
- **`AutoBotUtilities.Tests` Code (`AutoBotUtilities.Tests/PDFUtilsTests.cs`):**
  - Changes needed: Update `// TODO:` assertions with correct expected values.
  - Dependencies: Test PDF files accessible.

**Architecture Considerations:**
- Leverages existing `InvoiceReader` framework and OCR database for template-driven extraction.
- No significant architectural changes required.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Phase 1: Analysis & Template Design**
    - [ ] Analyze text structure of sample TEMU PDFs.
    - [ ] Identify key fields and patterns.
    - [ ] Design OCR template structure (Parts, Lines, Fields).
    - [ ] Draft initial regex patterns (identification and extraction).
2.  **Phase 2: Database Implementation (OCR DB)**
    - [ ] Write SQL `INSERT` statements for the TEMU template.
    - [ ] Execute SQL to add the template.
3.  **Phase 3: Testing & Refinement**
    - [ ] Run `CanImportTemuInvoice_07252024_TEMU` test.
    - [ ] Debug and refine regex in `OCR` database based on results.
    - [ ] Repeat until test passes with correct data.
4.  **Phase 4: Final Verification**
    - [ ] Update assertions in `PDFUtilsTests.cs`.
    - [ ] Run all TEMU tests.
    - [ ] Document template in memory bank.

**Detailed Steps:** (Covered within Implementation Strategy Phases)

**Dependencies:**
- Access to `OCR` database (schema and data modification).
- Access to sample TEMU PDF files used in tests.
- Understanding of the `InvoiceReader` framework and `OCR` DB schema (potentially requiring examination of existing templates).

**Challenges & Mitigations:**
- **Challenge:** Complex/Inconsistent TEMU PDF structure.
  - **Mitigation:** Detailed analysis, specific regex anchors. Escalate if regex proves insufficient (potential code change/rely on fallback AI).
- **Challenge:** `OCR` database access/permissions.
  - **Mitigation:** Confirm access during implementation phase. Task blocked if unavailable.
- **Challenge:** Understanding `OCR` DB schema for template creation.
  - **Mitigation:** Query existing templates in `OCR` DB during implementation.
- **Challenge:** Test PDF file accessibility.
  - **Mitigation:** Ensure files are accessible or copy to workspace during implementation.

**Creative Phase Components:**
- [X] ⚙️ Algorithm Design (Specifically, Regex pattern design for TEMU PDF structure)

[2025-05-07 17:10:57] - ## Task: Debug NullReferenceException in EmailShipment

**ID:** TASK_VAN_001
**Status:** Fix Implemented (Testing Pending)
**Priority:** High
**Assigned Mode:** IMPLEMENT
**Description:** A `NullReferenceException` occurs in the `EmailShipment` method in `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs` at line 152. The error is `Value cannot be null. Parameter name: source`, originating from `System.Linq.Enumerable.Sum` when called on `shipment.Invoices`. Suspected cause is `shipment.Invoices` being null.
**Files Involved:**
- `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs`
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `EmailShipment` method no longer throws a `NullReferenceException` when `shipment.Invoices` is null.
- The logic correctly handles cases where `shipment.Invoices` might be null or empty.
**Complexity Assessment (VAN):** Level 1 (Direct fix anticipated)
**Implementation Notes:**
- Applied fix to `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs` at line 152.
- Changed `shipment.Invoices.Sum(x => x.TotalsZero)` to `(shipment.Invoices?.Sum(x => x.TotalsZero) ?? 0)`.
- This ensures that if `shipment.Invoices` is null, the expression evaluates to `0`, preventing the `NullReferenceException`.
**Next Step:** Manual testing or integration testing is required to verify the fix in a runtime environment. Transition to REFLECT mode.

[2025-05-07 14:09:00] - ## Task: Debug Error in POUtils.CreatePOEntries

**ID:** TASK_VAN_002
**Status:** Planning
**Priority:** High
**Assigned Mode:** PLAN
**Original Description:** An error "One or more errors occurred" is reported, originating from `AutoBot.POUtils.CreatePOEntries` at line 790 in `AutoBot/POUtils.cs` (stack trace indicates `C:\Insight Software\Autobot-Enterprise.2.0\AutoBot\POUtils.cs:line 790`). The immediate cause is a `throw;` statement within a catch block. The actual error occurs when accessing `.Result` on the task returned by `BaseDataModel.Instance.AddToEntry(...)` on line 783.
**Suspected Cause:** An unhandled exception within the asynchronous operation of `BaseDataModel.Instance.AddToEntry(...)` or `BaseDataModel.Instance.ClearAsycudaDocumentSet(...)` due to blocking calls (`.Result` or `.Wait()`).

**Complexity:**
Level: 2
Type: Bug Fix / Refactor for Robustness

**Technology Stack:**
- Framework: .NET
- Language: C#
- Key Pattern: async/await

**Technology Validation Checkpoints:**
- [ ] Project builds successfully after async/await refactoring.
- [ ] (Conceptual) Error handling behaves as expected (no AggregateExceptions from this specific area, root cause logged).

**Implementation Plan:**

**Goal:** Refactor `POUtils.CreatePOEntries` and its callers to use `async/await` correctly, preventing `AggregateException` and ensuring proper error propagation and handling.

**Files to Modify (Primary):**
- `AutoBot/POUtils.cs` (and its partial class components like `AutoBot/POUtils/CreatePOEntries.cs`, `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreatePOEntries_Overload2.cs`, `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreateLatestPOEntries.cs`)
- Potentially `AutoBot/FileUtils.cs` and further up the call stack.

**Files to Investigate (Secondary):**
- `WaterNut.Business.Services/Custom Services/DataModels/Custom DataModels/BaseBusinessLayerDS.cs` (methods `AddToEntry`, `ClearAsycudaDocumentSet`, and methods they call).

**Detailed Steps:**
1.  **Refactor `POUtils.CreatePOEntries(int docSetId, List<int> entrylst)` to `async Task<List<DocumentCT>>`:**
    *   Locate definition (likely in `AutoBot/POUtils/CreatePOEntries.cs` or `AutoBot/POUtils.cs`).
    *   Change signature: `public static async Task<List<DocumentCT>> CreatePOEntries(int docSetId, List<int> entrylst)`
    *   Modify calls within:
        *   `await BaseDataModel.Instance.ClearAsycudaDocumentSet((int)docSetId).ConfigureAwait(false);`
        *   `return await BaseDataModel.Instance.AddToEntry(entrylst, docSetId, ..., false).ConfigureAwait(false);`
    *   Adjust `catch (Exception ex)` block: It will now catch the direct exception, not `AggregateException`. Logging/emailing `ex` directly is more informative.
2.  **Refactor `POUtils.RecreatePOEntries(int asycudaDocumentSetId)` to `async Task`:**
    *   Locate definition (in `AutoBot/POUtils.cs`).
    *   Change signature: `public static async Task RecreatePOEntries(int asycudaDocumentSetId)`
    *   Modify call within loop: `await CreatePOEntries(docSetId.DocSetId, docSetId.Entrylst).ConfigureAwait(false);`
    *   Adjust `catch (Exception ex)` block.
3.  **Investigate and Refactor Other Direct Callers of `CreatePOEntries(int, List<int>)`:**
    *   Examine `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreatePOEntries_Overload2.cs` and `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreateLatestPOEntries.cs`.
    *   Apply similar `async/await` refactoring to the calling methods within these files.
4.  **Propagate `async/await` Up the Call Stack:**
    *   The original stack trace included `AutoBot.FileUtils.<>c.<get_FileActions>b__1_7`. This lambda and the method it's part of (`get_FileActions` in `FileUtils.cs`) will likely need to become `async` and `await` the call to `RecreatePOEntries` (or the relevant refactored method).
    *   Continue this propagation as far as is reasonable or until an appropriate point where the async operation can be handled (e.g., an event handler in a UI, an API controller endpoint).
5.  **Testing (Conceptual):**
    *   Verify the application builds successfully.
    *   If possible, manually trigger the code path that previously caused the error.
    *   Confirm that if an error occurs within `AddToEntry` or `ClearAsycudaDocumentSet`, it's logged/reported without an `AggregateException` at the `POUtils` level, and the application handles it more gracefully.

**Creative Phases Required:**
- N/A (This is a bug fix and refactoring task)

**Dependencies:**
- Understanding of C# `async/await` patterns.
- Access to the codebase for `AutoBot` and `WaterNut.Business.Services`.

**Challenges & Mitigations:**
- **Async Propagation Scope:** The `async/await` changes might need to go far up the call stack.
    - **Mitigation:** Address this iteratively. Start with the core methods and expand. If it becomes too large for a Level 2, re-assess.
- **Understanding Business Logic:** The exact cause of failure within `AddToEntry` or `ClearAsycudaDocumentSet` is still unknown. The primary goal here is to fix the *handling* of such errors.
    - **Mitigation:** Focus on robust error propagation. A separate task might be needed to debug the root cause within those methods if it's complex.
- **Version/Path Mismatch:** The `Autobot-Enterprise.2.0` path in the stack trace.
    - **Mitigation:** Proceed with changes in the current workspace. If errors persist, this discrepancy will need investigation. Assume current workspace is canonical for now.

**Status:**
- [X] Initialization complete (VAN)
- [ ] Planning complete
- [ ] Technology validation complete
- [ ] Implementation steps

[2025-05-09 10:51:04] - ## New Task: Create Unit Test for GetTariffCode

**ID:** TASK_VAN_003
**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** Medium
**Assigned Mode:** VAN
**Request:** Create a unit test for the `GetTariffCode` method in `WaterNut.Business.Services\Custom Services\InventoryQS\InventoryItemsExService.cs`. The test should use "61091000" as the input parameter and be located in the `AutoBotUtilities.Tests` project.
**Files Involved:**
- `WaterNut.Business.Services\Custom Services\InventoryQS\InventoryItemsExService.cs` (method to be tested)
- A new test file or an existing one within `AutoBotUtilities.Tests` project.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A new unit test for `GetTariffCode` is created.
- The test passes when `GetTariffCode` behaves as expected with the input "61091000".
- The test is located in the `C:\Insight Software\AutoBot-Enterprise\AutoBotUtilities.Tests` project.
**Complexity Assessment (VAN):** Level 1 (Straightforward unit test creation)
[2025-05-09 10:53:47] - 
**Implementation Notes (TASK_VAN_003):**
- Created unit test file `AutoBotUtilities.Tests/InventoryItemsExServiceTests.cs`.
- Used NUnit framework as per existing project setup.
- Added test cases for input "61091000", null input, and empty string input.
- Corrected NUnit assertion syntax.
**Status:** Implemented (Testing to be performed by user)

[2025-05-10 12:13:58] - ## New Task: Create Email MCP Server

**Request:** Create an email MCP server based on the EmailDownloader project. Use connection settings from the database `applicationsettings` table.

**Status:** Pending VAN mode analysis.

[2025-05-10 12:16:10] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server
**Status:** VAN mode analysis in progress.
**Action:** Identifying necessary information, starting with database connection settings for email.
**Next Step:** Query `applicationsettings` table once details for retrieving email settings are clarified by the user.

[2025-05-10 12:21:42] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server
**Status:** VAN mode analysis complete.
**Details:** Email credentials retrieved: `documents.websource@auto-brokerage.com` / `WebSource`. Task complexity assessed as Level 2-4.
**Next Step:** Transition to PLAN mode for detailed planning.

[2025-05-10 12:27:14] - ## Implementation Plan: Create Email MCP Server (Level 3)

**Requirements Analysis:**
- Core Requirements:
  - [ ] Create a new MCP server using Node.js and TypeScript.
  - [ ] The server must connect to an email account using IMAP for reading emails.
  - [ ] The server must use the following connection details:
    -   Username: `documents.websource@auto-brokerage.com`
    -   Password: `WebSource`
    -   Incoming Server (IMAP): `mail.auto-brokerage.com`
    -   IMAP Port: 993 (SSL/TLS)
    -   (Optional for future) Outgoing Server (SMTP): `mail.auto-brokerage.com`
    -   (Optional for future) SMTP Port: 465 (SSL/TLS)
  - [ ] The server should expose MCP tools to:
    -   List emails (e.g., from INBOX, with optional filters for date, sender, subject).
    -   Fetch the content (body, headers) of a specific email.
    -   Download attachments from a specific email.
  - [ ] The server should draw inspiration and potentially adapt logic from the existing `EmailDownloader` C# project.
  - [ ] Credentials must be configurable via environment variables passed by the MCP host.
- Technical Constraints:
  - [ ] Must use the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
  - [ ] Server to be created in the standard MCP directory: `C:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Roo-Code\MCP`.
  - [ ] Error handling must be robust, providing clear messages for connection issues or operational failures.

**Component Analysis:**
- **Email MCP Server Project (New):**
  - Type: Node.js/TypeScript application.
  - Location: `C:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Roo-Code\MCP\email-mcp-server` (tentative name).
  - Changes needed: Full implementation.
  - Dependencies: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, an IMAP client library (e.g., `imapflow`), potentially a MIME parsing library.
- **Email Client Library (e.g., `imapflow`):**
  - Purpose: Handle IMAP connection, authentication, email fetching, and parsing.
  - Changes needed: Integration into the MCP server.
  - Dependencies: Node.js environment.
- **`mcp_settings.json`:**
  - Location: `c:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline\settings\mcp_settings.json`.
  - Changes needed: Add a new server entry for the email MCP server, including command, args, and environment variables for email credentials and server details.
  - Dependencies: Correct JSON formatting.

**Architecture Considerations (Design Decisions):**
- **MCP Tool Design:**
  - `list_emails`:
    - Input: `mailbox` (string, default: 'INBOX'), `criteria` (object, optional, e.g., `{ since: 'YYYY-MM-DD', from: 'sender@example.com', subjectContains: 'keyword' }`), `limit` (number, optional, default: 20).
    - Output: Array of email objects (e.g., `{ uid: string, subject: string, from: string, date: string, hasAttachments: boolean }`).
  - `get_email_details`:
    - Input: `mailbox` (string, default: 'INBOX'), `uid` (string, required).
    - Output: Email detail object (e.g., `{ uid: string, subject: string, from: string, to: string[], cc: string[], date: string, bodyText: string, bodyHtml: string, attachments: [{ filename: string, size: number, contentType: string, id: string }] }`).
  - `download_attachment`:
    - Input: `mailbox` (string, default: 'INBOX'), `uid` (string, required), `attachmentId` (string, required), `downloadPath` (string, required - path where Cline should suggest saving).
    - Output: Confirmation or file stream (MCP SDK specific handling for file content).
- **Authentication:** Credentials (`Email`, `EmailPassword`) and server details (`IMAP_HOST`, `IMAP_PORT`) will be passed as environment variables to the MCP server process, configured in `mcp_settings.json`.
- **Error Handling:** Implement try-catch blocks for all I/O operations (email server communication). Return structured `McpError` objects for failures.
- **Modularity:** Separate email interaction logic from MCP request handling logic.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Phase 1: Project Setup & Technology Validation**
    - [x] Use `npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server email-mcp-server` in `C:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Roo-Code\MCP`. (Completed in PLAN)

    - [x] Implement function to fetch full email structure (headers, body, attachments list) by UID. (Implemented in `index.ts`)
    - [x] Implement function to stream an attachment's content. (Implemented in `index.ts` as base64 content)
    - [x] Ensure robust error handling and logging for these core functions. (Implemented in `index.ts`)
3.  **Phase 3: MCP Tool Implementation**
    - [x] Implement the `list_emails` MCP tool, mapping input parameters to `imapflow` search criteria. (Implemented in `index.ts`, includes `list_mailboxes`)
    - [x] Implement the `get_email_details` MCP tool, fetching and parsing email content. (Implemented in `index.ts`)
    - [x] Implement the `download_attachment` MCP tool. (Implemented in `index.ts`)
    - [x] Define input and output schemas for each tool. (Implemented in `index.ts`)
4.  **Phase 4: Configuration & Build**
    - [x] Modify the MCP server to read email credentials and server settings from `process.env`. (Completed in PLAN)
    - [x] Update `package.json` build script if necessary. (Completed in PLAN)
    - [x] Build the server (`npm run build`). (Completed in PLAN)
    - [x] Prepare the entry for `mcp_settings.json`. (Completed in PLAN)

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests (Optional but Recommended):**
  - [ ] For utility functions (e.g., criteria mapping, email data transformation). Mock the email client library.
- **Integration/Manual Tests:**
  - [ ] Test `list_emails` tool with various criteria.
  - [ ] Test `get_email_details` for emails with and without attachments, different body types.
  - [ ] Test `download_attachment` for various file types.
  - [ ] Test error handling (e.g., invalid credentials, server down - if possible to simulate).
  - [ ] All testing will be done by invoking tools via Cline after configuring the server.

**Documentation Plan:**
- [ ] Update `tasks.md` with this completed plan.
- [ ] Add brief notes on how to use the new MCP tools in `activeContext.md` or a new `email-mcp-server-usage.md` in the memory bank upon completion.

**Technology Stack:**
- Framework: Node.js
- Language: TypeScript
- Build Tool: `tsc`, `npm scripts`
- Key Libraries: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `imapflow` (for IMAP), `mailparser` (if `imapflow` doesn't provide sufficient parsing).
- Storage: N/A (server is stateless, email data resides on the mail server).

**Technology Validation Checkpoints:**
- [ ] Project initialization command (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server email-mcp-server`) verified.
- [ ] Required dependencies (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `imapflow`) identified and can be installed.
- [ ] Build configuration (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json` scripts) validated.
- [ ] "Hello world" MCP tool (e.g., a simple echo tool) runs successfully.
- [ ] Test build passes successfully.
- [ ] Basic IMAP connection to `mail.auto-brokerage.com:993` with `imapflow` is successful (can be a separate test script initially).

**Creative Phases Required:**
- [ ] N/A (Standard email client functionality, no novel algorithms or complex UI/Arch design expected for core features).

**Dependencies:**
- Access to the `EmailDownloader` C# project for logic reference.
- Node.js (v16+) and npm installed on the system.
- Network access to `mail.auto-brokerage.com` on port 993.

**Challenges & Mitigations:**
- **Challenge:** Complexity in adapting logic from C# `EmailDownloader` to TypeScript/Node.js.
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on understanding the core IMAP operations in `EmailDownloader` rather than a direct port. Implement features incrementally.
- **Challenge:** Email server specific behaviors or IMAP command interpretations.
  - **Mitigation:** Rely on a well-maintained library like `imapflow`. Test thoroughly against the target server.
- **Challenge:** Handling diverse email structures and MIME types.
  - **Mitigation:** Use `mailparser` or similar robust library if `imapflow`'s built-in parsing is insufficient. Start with common cases and expand if needed.
- **Challenge:** Ensuring secure handling of credentials (even if passed via env vars).
  - **Mitigation:** The MCP framework handles the env var injection. The server code itself should not log credentials.

**Status:**
- [X] Initialization complete (VAN)
- [X] Planning complete (PLAN)
- [ ] Technology validation pending
- [ ] Implementation steps pending

[2025-05-10 12:41:08] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server - Technology Validation Progress

**Phase:** Technology Validation (PLAN Mode)

**Technology Validation Checkpoints Status:**
- [X] Project initialization command (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server email-mcp-server`) verified.
- [X] Required dependencies (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `imapflow`, `mailparser`, `@types/imapflow`) identified and installed.
- [X] Build configuration (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json` scripts) validated (project builds successfully).
- [X] Test build passes successfully.
- [ ] "Hello world" MCP tool runs successfully (Awaiting MCP server reload and confirmation).
- [ ] Basic IMAP connection to `mail.auto-brokerage.com:993` with `imapflow` is successful (Awaiting MCP server reload and log review from `testImapConnection()` output).

**Next Step:** Review MCP server status and logs in the next system update to confirm the remaining checkpoints. Update `mcp_settings.json` has been completed.

[2025-05-10 12:43:27] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server - Technology Validation Results

**Phase:** Technology Validation (PLAN Mode)

**Technology Validation Checkpoints Status:**
- [X] Project initialization command (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server email-mcp-server`) verified.
- [X] Required dependencies (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `imapflow`, `mailparser`, `@types/imapflow`) identified and installed.
- [X] Build configuration (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json` scripts) validated (project builds successfully).
- [X] Test build passes successfully.
- [X] "Hello world" MCP tool runs successfully (Server connected, tool available).
- [ ] Basic IMAP connection to `mail.auto-brokerage.com:993` with `imapflow` is successful (Connection to IMAP server established, but login for `documents.websource@auto-brokerage.com` failed with error: "Login disabled.").

**Issue:** The IMAP server `mail.auto-brokerage.com` is rejecting the login attempt for the provided credentials with the message "Login disabled." This prevents full validation of the email functionality.

**Next Step:** User needs to investigate the "Login disabled" issue for the email account `documents.websource@auto-brokerage.com`. Technology validation cannot be fully completed until IMAP login is successful.

[2025-05-10 12:53:05] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server - Technology Validation Re-test

**Phase:** Technology Validation (PLAN Mode)

**Action:** User requested changing the email address for IMAP test to `websource@auto-brokerage.com` (password remains `WebSource`).
- Updated `C:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Roo-Code\MCP\email-mcp-server\src\index.ts` with the new email for `testImapConnection()`.
- Updated `c:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline\settings\mcp_settings.json` with the new `EMAIL_USER`.
- Rebuilt the `email-mcp-server`.

[2025-05-10 12:53:22] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server - Technology Validation Re-test Results

**Phase:** Technology Validation (PLAN Mode)

**Action:** Re-tested IMAP connection with email `websource@auto-brokerage.com` and password `WebSource`.

**Technology Validation Checkpoints Status:**
- [X] Project initialization command verified.
- [X] Required dependencies identified and installed.
- [X] Build configuration validated.
- [X] Test build passes successfully.
- [X] "Hello world" MCP tool runs successfully.
- [ ] Basic IMAP connection to `mail.auto-brokerage.com:993` with `imapflow` is successful (Connection to IMAP server established, but login for `websource@auto-brokerage.com` failed with error: "Authentication failed.").

**Issue:** The IMAP server `mail.auto-brokerage.com` is rejecting the login attempt for `websource@auto-brokerage.com` with the password `WebSource`, reporting "Authentication failed." This suggests the username/password combination is incorrect.

**Next Step:** User needs to verify the password for the email account `websource@auto-brokerage.com` or provide a known working combination. Technology validation cannot be fully completed until IMAP login is successful.

## Implementation Plan (Level 2)

**Overview of Changes:**
This plan outlines the steps to build the `AutoBot-Enterprise` solution and then identify and fix asynchronous programming issues within the `EmailDownloader` and `AutoBot1` (specifically `AutoBot.csproj`) projects. The goal is to ensure the solution builds successfully and that async operations in the specified projects are correctly implemented to avoid deadlocks, improve performance, and enhance error handling.

**Files to Modify (Potential - based on async issue investigation):**
- `EmailDownloader/EmailDownLoader.cs`
- `EmailDownloader/Client.cs` (if async calls originate or are handled here)
- `AutoBot1/Program.cs`
- `AutoBot1/FolderProcessor.cs` (if it contains async logic)
- Other `.cs` files within `EmailDownloader` and `AutoBot1` projects as identified during the investigation.

**Technology Stack:**
- Framework: .NET Framework 4.8 (as per BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Language: C#
- Build Tool: MSBuild (via Visual Studio 2022)
- Key Pattern: async/await

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Build the Entire Solution:**
    *   Execute the build command from `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:
        ```powershell
        & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" AutoBot-Enterprise.sln /t:Clean,Restore,Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
        ```
    *   Analyze build output for any initial errors. Resolve critical build failures across the solution if they prevent focused work on target projects. (Note: Task is to *fix only* EmailDownloader and AutoBot1 async issues, but a baseline build is needed).
2.  **Investigate Async Issues in `EmailDownloader` Project:**
    *   Review code in `EmailDownloader.cs` and other relevant files for `async/await` usage.
    *   Look for common anti-patterns: `async void`, `.Result`, `.Wait()`, incorrect `ConfigureAwait(false)` usage, lack of error handling in async methods.
    *   Identify specific areas needing refactoring.
3.  **Fix Async Issues in `EmailDownloader` Project:**
    *   Apply necessary code changes to implement `async/await` correctly.
    *   Ensure proper exception handling for async operations.
    *   Rebuild the `EmailDownloader.csproj` project specifically to check for compilation errors:
        ```powershell
        & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" "EmailDownloader\EmailDownloader.csproj" /t:Clean,Restore,Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
        ```
4.  **Investigate Async Issues in `AutoBot1` Project (`AutoBot.csproj`):**
    *   Review code in `Program.cs`, `FolderProcessor.cs`, and other relevant files for `async/await` usage.
    *   Look for similar anti-patterns as in `EmailDownloader`.
    *   Identify specific areas needing refactoring.
5.  **Fix Async Issues in `AutoBot1` Project:**
    *   Apply necessary code changes.
    *   Ensure proper exception handling.
    *   Rebuild the `AutoBot1/AutoBot.csproj` project specifically:
        ```powershell
        & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" "AutoBot1\AutoBot.csproj" /t:Clean,Restore,Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
        ```
6.  **Final Solution Rebuild and Verification:**
    *   Rebuild the entire `AutoBot-Enterprise.sln` again to ensure no new issues were introduced.
    *   Perform basic smoke testing if possible/applicable for the affected async functionalities (e.g., if EmailDownloader has a test console or a simple trigger mechanism).

**Potential Challenges:**
-   **Cascading Async Changes:** Refactoring one async method might require changes up the call stack, potentially outside the initially scoped projects. The plan is to focus fixes *within* `EmailDownloader` and `AutoBot1`, but awareness of wider impact is needed.
-   **Build Failures in Unrelated Projects:** The initial full solution build might reveal errors in other projects. These should be noted but not fixed unless they block the primary task.
-   **Lack of Unit Tests:** Identifying the impact of async refactoring might be difficult without existing unit tests for the affected components.
-   **Understanding Existing Logic:** Complex existing codebases can make it challenging to refactor async patterns without unintended side effects.

**Testing Strategy:**
-   **Build Verification:** Successful compilation of individual projects and the entire solution is the primary verification method for this task's scope.
-   **Code Review:** Review refactored async code for correctness and adherence to best practices.
-   **Manual Smoke Testing (Limited):** If entry points for the modified async operations are easily accessible (e.g., a console app start, a specific UI action that can be manually triggered if `AutoBot1` is part of a larger runnable system), perform a quick test to see if the core functionality still works and doesn't hang or throw obvious new errors.
-   **Focus on Build Success:** The main goal is to fix build issues related to async and ensure the specified projects build cleanly with correct async patterns.

**Technology Validation Checkpoints:**
- [ ] .NET Framework 4.8 and C# are the correct technologies for the target projects.
- [ ] MSBuild command from `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` is valid and executable.
- [ ] `async/await` patterns are applicable and the standard approach for the identified issues.
- [ ] Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise is the assumed development environment.
