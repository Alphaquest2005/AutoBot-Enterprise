# Tasks
[2025-05-03 16:47:47] - ## Task: Setup Advanced Memory Bank

**Complexity Level:** 2 (Simple Enhancement)

**Description:** Setup the memory bank from https://github.com/enescingoz/roo-advanced-memory-bank. Involves cloning, configuring modes, and initializing the VAN workflow.

[2025-05-03 16:53:31] - ## Implementation Plan (Level 2)
- [x] Clone `advanced-memory-bank` repository.
- [x] Move `.roomodes` to workspace root.
- [x] Update paths within `.roomodes`.
- [x] Switch to VAN mode.
- [x] Run VAN initialization (create `tasks.md`, determine complexity).
- [x] Switch to PLAN mode.
- [x] Perform Technology Validation (verify modes load, essential files exist).
- [x] Update `tasks.md` with final status.
- [x] Verify plan completeness.

## Technology Validation
- **Stack:** Roo Code custom modes (`.roomodes`), rule files (`advanced-memory-bank/.roo/rules/`).
- **Validation:**
  - [x] Custom modes (VAN, PLAN) load successfully.
  - [x] Essential files (`.roomodes`, `tasks.md`) exist in correct locations.
  - [x] Core rule files appear present (though specific Level 2 files were missing).
  - [x] Technology validation complete.

## Status
- [x] Initialization complete (VAN)
- [x] Planning complete (PLAN)
- [x] Technology validation complete (PLAN)
- [x] Implementation complete (Setup task finished)

## Challenges & Mitigations
- **Challenge:** Missing Level 2 rule files (`enhancement-planning.mdc`, `task-tracking-basic.mdc`).
  - **Mitigation:** Followed general Level 2 steps from `plan-mode-map.mdc` and adapted.
- **Challenge:** `.roomodes` file initially in subdirectory.
  - **Mitigation:** Moved file to root and updated internal paths.

[2025-05-05 08:49:31] - ## New Task: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis (autobot1/autobot)

**Request:** Execute a comprehensive analysis of the `autobot1\autobot` project codebase. The analysis must encompass the primary project and identify/include all directly related sub-projects, libraries, and data stores referenced within its configuration files or build scripts. Thoroughly examine the project's architecture, key functionalities, component interactions, data processing pipelines, dependencies (internal and external), and technology stack. Synthesize these findings into a structured summary document suitable for a knowledge base. This summary must explicitly detail: high-level architecture, core modules/components and their responsibilities, key data structures/schemas, critical execution flows/algorithms, mapping of functionalities to code locations, a list of identified technologies/frameworks/libraries with versions, location/purpose of configuration files, and external service dependencies. This summary will provide actionable context to enhance logging systems with component information, validate file/resource path accuracy, maintain an up-to-date technology inventory, improve project documentation, and refactor the project to follow SOLID principles.

[2025-05-05 13:31:30] - ## Task Update: Scope Broadened to Full Workspace Analysis

**Reason:** Initial target directory `autobot1/autobot` not found. User requested a full workspace scan (file listing and definition summary) to build comprehensive context before proceeding with detailed analysis and refactoring.

[2025-05-05 16:54:48] - ## New Task: Create TEMU Invoice Import SQL Entries

**Request:** Based on the memory bank, create a plan for database entries required to import TEMU invoices into the `WebSource-AutoBot` database. Analyze existing invoice import mechanisms (e.g., Amazon) and the database schema (`Actions`, `FileTypes`, `EmailInfoMappings`, `InfoMapping`, `InfoMappingRegEx`, etc.) to determine the necessary SQL `INSERT` statements. Use `AutoBotUtilities.Tests\PDFUtilsTests.cs::CanImportTemuInvoice_07252024_TEMU()` for verification. Add learnings to the memory bank.

**Complexity Level:** 3 (Moderate Complexity)

[2025-05-05 17:06:09] - ## Implementation Plan: TEMU Invoice Import (Level 3)

**Requirements Analysis:**
- Core Requirements:
  - [ ] Create a mechanism to import TEMU PDF invoices.
  - [ ] Extract key header fields (e.g., InvoiceNo, Date, Total) and line item details (e.g., Item Description, Quantity, Price) from TEMU PDFs.
  - [ ] Store extracted data in the `WebSource-AutoBot` database (`ShipmentInvoice`, `ShipmentInvoiceDetails` tables).
  - [ ] Utilize the existing `InvoiceReader` framework by defining a new OCR template in the `OCR` database.
  - [ ] Ensure import works for sample TEMU PDFs from tests.
  - [ ] Verify results using `CanImportTemuInvoice_07252024_TEMU` test.
- Technical Constraints:
  - [ ] Must integrate with the existing `PDFUtils` -> `InvoiceReader` flow.
  - [ ] Requires access to and ability to modify the `OCR` database (separate from `WebSource-AutoBot`).

**Component Analysis:**
- **`OCR` Database:**
  - Changes needed: Add new rows to `Invoices`, `Parts`, `Lines`, `Fields`, `RegularExpressions`, `InvoiceIdentificatonRegEx` tables for TEMU template.
  - Dependencies: Schema understanding, example regex from other templates.
- **`WebSource-AutoBot` Database:**
  - Changes needed: Verify `FileType` ID 1147 configuration. No schema changes expected.
  - Dependencies: `FileType` 1147 exists and triggers the correct action.
- **`InvoiceReader` Code (`WaterNut.Business.Services/.../InvoiceReader.cs`):**
  - Changes needed: None anticipated initially.
  - Dependencies: `PdfPig`, Tesseract (`PdfOcr`).
- **`PDFUtils` Code (`AutoBot/PDFUtils.cs`):**
  - Changes needed: None anticipated.
  - Dependencies: Calls `InvoiceReader`.
- **`AutoBotUtilities.Tests` Code (`AutoBotUtilities.Tests/PDFUtilsTests.cs`):**
  - Changes needed: Update `// TODO:` assertions with correct expected values.
  - Dependencies: Test PDF files accessible.

**Architecture Considerations:**
- Leverages existing `InvoiceReader` framework and OCR database for template-driven extraction.
- No significant architectural changes required.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Phase 1: Analysis & Template Design**
    - [ ] Analyze text structure of sample TEMU PDFs.
    - [ ] Identify key fields and patterns.
    - [ ] Design OCR template structure (Parts, Lines, Fields).
    - [ ] Draft initial regex patterns (identification and extraction).
2.  **Phase 2: Database Implementation (OCR DB)**
    - [ ] Write SQL `INSERT` statements for the TEMU template.
    - [ ] Execute SQL to add the template.
3.  **Phase 3: Testing & Refinement**
    - [ ] Run `CanImportTemuInvoice_07252024_TEMU` test.
    - [ ] Debug and refine regex in `OCR` database based on results.
    - [ ] Repeat until test passes with correct data.
4.  **Phase 4: Final Verification**
    - [ ] Update assertions in `PDFUtilsTests.cs`.
    - [ ] Run all TEMU tests.
    - [ ] Document template in memory bank.

**Detailed Steps:** (Covered within Implementation Strategy Phases)

**Dependencies:**
- Access to `OCR` database (schema and data modification).
- Access to sample TEMU PDF files used in tests.
- Understanding of the `InvoiceReader` framework and `OCR` DB schema (potentially requiring examination of existing templates).

**Challenges & Mitigations:**
- **Challenge:** Complex/Inconsistent TEMU PDF structure.
  - **Mitigation:** Detailed analysis, specific regex anchors. Escalate if regex proves insufficient (potential code change/rely on fallback AI).
- **Challenge:** `OCR` database access/permissions.
  - **Mitigation:** Confirm access during implementation phase. Task blocked if unavailable.
- **Challenge:** Understanding `OCR` DB schema for template creation.
  - **Mitigation:** Query existing templates in `OCR` DB during implementation.
- **Challenge:** Test PDF file accessibility.
  - **Mitigation:** Ensure files are accessible or copy to workspace during implementation.

**Creative Phase Components:**
- [X] ⚙️ Algorithm Design (Specifically, Regex pattern design for TEMU PDF structure)

[2025-05-07 17:10:57] - ## Task: Debug NullReferenceException in EmailShipment

**ID:** TASK_VAN_001
**Status:** Fix Implemented (Testing Pending)
**Priority:** High
**Assigned Mode:** IMPLEMENT
**Description:** A `NullReferenceException` occurs in the `EmailShipment` method in `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs` at line 152. The error is `Value cannot be null. Parameter name: source`, originating from `System.Linq.Enumerable.Sum` when called on `shipment.Invoices`. Suspected cause is `shipment.Invoices` being null.
**Files Involved:**
- `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs`
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `EmailShipment` method no longer throws a `NullReferenceException` when `shipment.Invoices` is null.
- The logic correctly handles cases where `shipment.Invoices` might be null or empty.
**Complexity Assessment (VAN):** Level 1 (Direct fix anticipated)
**Implementation Notes:**
- Applied fix to `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs` at line 152.
- Changed `shipment.Invoices.Sum(x => x.TotalsZero)` to `(shipment.Invoices?.Sum(x => x.TotalsZero) ?? 0)`.
- This ensures that if `shipment.Invoices` is null, the expression evaluates to `0`, preventing the `NullReferenceException`.
**Next Step:** Manual testing or integration testing is required to verify the fix in a runtime environment. Transition to REFLECT mode.

[2025-05-07 14:09:00] - ## Task: Debug Error in POUtils.CreatePOEntries

**ID:** TASK_VAN_002
**Status:** Planning
**Priority:** High
**Assigned Mode:** PLAN
**Original Description:** An error "One or more errors occurred" is reported, originating from `AutoBot.POUtils.CreatePOEntries` at line 790 in `AutoBot/POUtils.cs` (stack trace indicates `C:\Insight Software\Autobot-Enterprise.2.0\AutoBot\POUtils.cs:line 790`). The immediate cause is a `throw;` statement within a catch block. The actual error occurs when accessing `.Result` on the task returned by `BaseDataModel.Instance.AddToEntry(...)` on line 783.
**Suspected Cause:** An unhandled exception within the asynchronous operation of `BaseDataModel.Instance.AddToEntry(...)` or `BaseDataModel.Instance.ClearAsycudaDocumentSet(...)` due to blocking calls (`.Result` or `.Wait()`).

**Complexity:**
Level: 2
Type: Bug Fix / Refactor for Robustness

**Technology Stack:**
- Framework: .NET
- Language: C#
- Key Pattern: async/await

**Technology Validation Checkpoints:**
- [ ] Project builds successfully after async/await refactoring.
- [ ] (Conceptual) Error handling behaves as expected (no AggregateExceptions from this specific area, root cause logged).

**Implementation Plan:**

**Goal:** Refactor `POUtils.CreatePOEntries` and its callers to use `async/await` correctly, preventing `AggregateException` and ensuring proper error propagation and handling.

**Files to Modify (Primary):**
- `AutoBot/POUtils.cs` (and its partial class components like `AutoBot/POUtils/CreatePOEntries.cs`, `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreatePOEntries_Overload2.cs`, `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreateLatestPOEntries.cs`)
- Potentially `AutoBot/FileUtils.cs` and further up the call stack.

**Files to Investigate (Secondary):**
- `WaterNut.Business.Services/Custom Services/DataModels/Custom DataModels/BaseBusinessLayerDS.cs` (methods `AddToEntry`, `ClearAsycudaDocumentSet`, and methods they call).

**Detailed Steps:**
1.  **Refactor `POUtils.CreatePOEntries(int docSetId, List<int> entrylst)` to `async Task<List<DocumentCT>>`:**
    *   Locate definition (likely in `AutoBot/POUtils/CreatePOEntries.cs` or `AutoBot/POUtils.cs`).
    *   Change signature: `public static async Task<List<DocumentCT>> CreatePOEntries(int docSetId, List<int> entrylst)`
    *   Modify calls within:
        *   `await BaseDataModel.Instance.ClearAsycudaDocumentSet((int)docSetId).ConfigureAwait(false);`
        *   `return await BaseDataModel.Instance.AddToEntry(entrylst, docSetId, ..., false).ConfigureAwait(false);`
    *   Adjust `catch (Exception ex)` block: It will now catch the direct exception, not `AggregateException`. Logging/emailing `ex` directly is more informative.
2.  **Refactor `POUtils.RecreatePOEntries(int asycudaDocumentSetId)` to `async Task`:**
    *   Locate definition (in `AutoBot/POUtils.cs`).
    *   Change signature: `public static async Task RecreatePOEntries(int asycudaDocumentSetId)`
    *   Modify call within loop: `await CreatePOEntries(docSetId.DocSetId, docSetId.Entrylst).ConfigureAwait(false);`
    *   Adjust `catch (Exception ex)` block.
3.  **Investigate and Refactor Other Direct Callers of `CreatePOEntries(int, List<int>)`:**
    *   Examine `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreatePOEntries_Overload2.cs` and `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreateLatestPOEntries.cs`.
    *   Apply similar `async/await` refactoring to the calling methods within these files.
4.  **Propagate `async/await` Up the Call Stack:**
    *   The original stack trace included `AutoBot.FileUtils.<>c.<get_FileActions>b__1_7`. This lambda and the method it's part of (`get_FileActions` in `FileUtils.cs`) will likely need to become `async` and `await` the call to `RecreatePOEntries` (or the relevant refactored method).
    *   Continue this propagation as far as is reasonable or until an appropriate point where the async operation can be handled (e.g., an event handler in a UI, an API controller endpoint).
5.  **Testing (Conceptual):**
    *   Verify the application builds successfully.
    *   If possible, manually trigger the code path that previously caused the error.
    *   Confirm that if an error occurs within `AddToEntry` or `ClearAsycudaDocumentSet`, it's logged/reported without an `AggregateException` at the `POUtils` level, and the application handles it more gracefully.

**Creative Phases Required:**
- N/A (This is a bug fix and refactoring task)

**Dependencies:**
- Understanding of C# `async/await` patterns.
- Access to the codebase for `AutoBot` and `WaterNut.Business.Services`.

**Challenges & Mitigations:**
- **Async Propagation Scope:** The `async/await` changes might need to go far up the call stack.
    - **Mitigation:** Address this iteratively. Start with the core methods and expand. If it becomes too large for a Level 2, re-assess.
- **Understanding Business Logic:** The exact cause of failure within `AddToEntry` or `ClearAsycudaDocumentSet` is still unknown. The primary goal here is to fix the *handling* of such errors.
    - **Mitigation:** Focus on robust error propagation. A separate task might be needed to debug the root cause within those methods if it's complex.
- **Version/Path Mismatch:** The `Autobot-Enterprise.2.0` path in the stack trace.
    - **Mitigation:** Proceed with changes in the current workspace. If errors persist, this discrepancy will need investigation. Assume current workspace is canonical for now.

**Status:**
- [X] Initialization complete (VAN)
- [ ] Planning complete
- [ ] Technology validation complete
- [ ] Implementation steps
