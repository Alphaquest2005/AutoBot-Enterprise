# Tasks
[2025-05-03 16:47:47] - ## Task: Setup Advanced Memory Bank

**Complexity Level:** 2 (Simple Enhancement)

**Description:** Setup the memory bank from https://github.com/enescingoz/roo-advanced-memory-bank. Involves cloning, configuring modes, and initializing the VAN workflow.

[2025-05-03 16:53:31] - ## Implementation Plan (Level 2)
- [x] Clone `advanced-memory-bank` repository.
- [x] Move `.roomodes` to workspace root.
- [x] Update paths within `.roomodes`.
- [x] Switch to VAN mode.
- [x] Run VAN initialization (create `tasks.md`, determine complexity).
- [x] Switch to PLAN mode.
- [x] Perform Technology Validation (verify modes load, essential files exist).
- [x] Update `tasks.md` with final status.
- [x] Verify plan completeness.

## Technology Validation
- **Stack:** Roo Code custom modes (`.roomodes`), rule files (`advanced-memory-bank/.roo/rules/`).
- **Validation:**
  - [x] Custom modes (VAN, PLAN) load successfully.
  - [x] Essential files (`.roomodes`, `tasks.md`) exist in correct locations.
  - [x] Core rule files appear present (though specific Level 2 files were missing).
  - [x] Technology validation complete.

## Status
- [x] Initialization complete (VAN)
- [x] Planning complete (PLAN)
- [x] Technology validation complete (PLAN)
- [x] Implementation complete (Setup task finished)

## Challenges & Mitigations
- **Challenge:** Missing Level 2 rule files (`enhancement-planning.mdc`, `task-tracking-basic.mdc`).
  - **Mitigation:** Followed general Level 2 steps from `plan-mode-map.mdc` and adapted.
- **Challenge:** `.roomodes` file initially in subdirectory.
  - **Mitigation:** Moved file to root and updated internal paths.
