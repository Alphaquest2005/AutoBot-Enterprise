# Tasks
[2025-05-03 16:47:47] - ## Task: Setup Advanced Memory Bank

**Complexity Level:** 2 (Simple Enhancement)

**Description:** Setup the memory bank from https://github.com/enescingoz/roo-advanced-memory-bank. Involves cloning, configuring modes, and initializing the VAN workflow.

[2025-05-03 16:53:31] - ## Implementation Plan (Level 2)
- [x] Clone `advanced-memory-bank` repository.
- [x] Move `.roomodes` to workspace root.
- [x] Update paths within `.roomodes`.
- [x] Switch to VAN mode.
- [x] Run VAN initialization (create `tasks.md`, determine complexity).
- [x] Switch to PLAN mode.
- [x] Perform Technology Validation (verify modes load, essential files exist).
- [x] Update `tasks.md` with final status.
- [x] Verify plan completeness.

## Technology Validation
- **Stack:** Roo Code custom modes (`.roomodes`), rule files (`advanced-memory-bank/.roo/rules/`).
- **Validation:**
  - [x] Custom modes (VAN, PLAN) load successfully.
  - [x] Essential files (`.roomodes`, `tasks.md`) exist in correct locations.
  - [x] Core rule files appear present (though specific Level 2 files were missing).
  - [x] Technology validation complete.

## Status
- [x] Initialization complete (VAN)
- [x] Planning complete (PLAN)
- [x] Technology validation complete (PLAN)
- [x] Implementation complete (Setup task finished)

## Challenges & Mitigations
- **Challenge:** Missing Level 2 rule files (`enhancement-planning.mdc`, `task-tracking-basic.mdc`).
  - **Mitigation:** Followed general Level 2 steps from `plan-mode-map.mdc` and adapted.
- **Challenge:** `.roomodes` file initially in subdirectory.
  - **Mitigation:** Moved file to root and updated internal paths.

[2025-05-05 08:49:31] - ## New Task: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis (autobot1/autobot)

**Request:** Execute a comprehensive analysis of the `autobot1\autobot` project codebase. The analysis must encompass the primary project and identify/include all directly related sub-projects, libraries, and data stores referenced within its configuration files or build scripts. Thoroughly examine the project's architecture, key functionalities, component interactions, data processing pipelines, dependencies (internal and external), and technology stack. Synthesize these findings into a structured summary document suitable for a knowledge base. This summary must explicitly detail: high-level architecture, core modules/components and their responsibilities, key data structures/schemas, critical execution flows/algorithms, mapping of functionalities to code locations, a list of identified technologies/frameworks/libraries with versions, location/purpose of configuration files, and external service dependencies. This summary will provide actionable context to enhance logging systems with component information, validate file/resource path accuracy, maintain an up-to-date technology inventory, improve project documentation, and refactor the project to follow SOLID principles.

[2025-05-05 13:31:30] - ## Task Update: Scope Broadened to Full Workspace Analysis

**Reason:** Initial target directory `autobot1/autobot` not found. User requested a full workspace scan (file listing and definition summary) to build comprehensive context before proceeding with detailed analysis and refactoring.

[2025-05-05 16:54:48] - ## New Task: Create TEMU Invoice Import SQL Entries

**Request:** Based on the memory bank, create a plan for database entries required to import TEMU invoices into the `WebSource-AutoBot` database. Analyze existing invoice import mechanisms (e.g., Amazon) and the database schema (`Actions`, `FileTypes`, `EmailInfoMappings`, `InfoMapping`, `InfoMappingRegEx`, etc.) to determine the necessary SQL `INSERT` statements. Use `AutoBotUtilities.Tests\PDFUtilsTests.cs::CanImportTemuInvoice_07252024_TEMU()` for verification. Add learnings to the memory bank.

**Complexity Level:** 3 (Moderate Complexity)

[2025-05-05 17:06:09] - ## Implementation Plan: TEMU Invoice Import (Level 3)

**Requirements Analysis:**
- Core Requirements:
  - [ ] Create a mechanism to import TEMU PDF invoices.
  - [ ] Extract key header fields (e.g., InvoiceNo, Date, Total) and line item details (e.g., Item Description, Quantity, Price) from TEMU PDFs.
  - [ ] Store extracted data in the `WebSource-AutoBot` database (`ShipmentInvoice`, `ShipmentInvoiceDetails` tables).
  - [ ] Utilize the existing `InvoiceReader` framework by defining a new OCR template in the `OCR` database.
  - [ ] Ensure import works for sample TEMU PDFs from tests.
  - [ ] Verify results using `CanImportTemuInvoice_07252024_TEMU` test.
- Technical Constraints:
  - [ ] Must integrate with the existing `PDFUtils` -> `InvoiceReader` flow.
  - [ ] Requires access to and ability to modify the `OCR` database (separate from `WebSource-AutoBot`).

**Component Analysis:**
- **`OCR` Database:**
  - Changes needed: Add new rows to `Invoices`, `Parts`, `Lines`, `Fields`, `RegularExpressions`, `InvoiceIdentificatonRegEx` tables for TEMU template.
  - Dependencies: Schema understanding, example regex from other templates.
- **`WebSource-AutoBot` Database:**
  - Changes needed: Verify `FileType` ID 1147 configuration. No schema changes expected.
  - Dependencies: `FileType` 1147 exists and triggers the correct action.
- **`InvoiceReader` Code (`WaterNut.Business.Services/.../InvoiceReader.cs`):**
  - Changes needed: None anticipated initially.
  - Dependencies: `PdfPig`, Tesseract (`PdfOcr`).
- **`PDFUtils` Code (`AutoBot/PDFUtils.cs`):**
  - Changes needed: None anticipated.
  - Dependencies: Calls `InvoiceReader`.
- **`AutoBotUtilities.Tests` Code (`AutoBotUtilities.Tests/PDFUtilsTests.cs`):**
  - Changes needed: Update `// TODO:` assertions with correct expected values.
  - Dependencies: Test PDF files accessible.

**Architecture Considerations:**
- Leverages existing `InvoiceReader` framework and OCR database for template-driven extraction.
- No significant architectural changes required.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Phase 1: Analysis & Template Design**
    - [ ] Analyze text structure of sample TEMU PDFs.
    - [ ] Identify key fields and patterns.
    - [ ] Design OCR template structure (Parts, Lines, Fields).
    - [ ] Draft initial regex patterns (identification and extraction).
2.  **Phase 2: Database Implementation (OCR DB)**
    - [ ] Write SQL `INSERT` statements for the TEMU template.
    - [ ] Execute SQL to add the template.
3.  **Phase 3: Testing & Refinement**
    - [ ] Run `CanImportTemuInvoice_07252024_TEMU` test.
    - [ ] Debug and refine regex in `OCR` database based on results.
    - [ ] Repeat until test passes with correct data.
4.  **Phase 4: Final Verification**
    - [ ] Update assertions in `PDFUtilsTests.cs`.
    - [ ] Run all TEMU tests.
    - [ ] Document template in memory bank.

**Detailed Steps:** (Covered within Implementation Strategy Phases)

**Dependencies:**
- Access to `OCR` database (schema and data modification).
- Access to sample TEMU PDF files used in tests.
- Understanding of the `InvoiceReader` framework and `OCR` DB schema (potentially requiring examination of existing templates).

**Challenges & Mitigations:**
- **Challenge:** Complex/Inconsistent TEMU PDF structure.
  - **Mitigation:** Detailed analysis, specific regex anchors. Escalate if regex proves insufficient (potential code change/rely on fallback AI).
- **Challenge:** `OCR` database access/permissions.
  - **Mitigation:** Confirm access during implementation phase. Task blocked if unavailable.
- **Challenge:** Understanding `OCR` DB schema for template creation.
  - **Mitigation:** Query existing templates in `OCR` DB during implementation.
- **Challenge:** Test PDF file accessibility.
  - **Mitigation:** Ensure files are accessible or copy to workspace during implementation.

**Creative Phase Components:**
- [X] ⚙️ Algorithm Design (Specifically, Regex pattern design for TEMU PDF structure)

[2025-05-07 17:10:57] - ## Task: Debug NullReferenceException in EmailShipment

**ID:** TASK_VAN_001
**Status:** Fix Implemented (Testing Pending)
**Priority:** High
**Assigned Mode:** IMPLEMENT
**Description:** A `NullReferenceException` occurs in the `EmailShipment` method in `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs` at line 152. The error is `Value cannot be null. Parameter name: source`, originating from `System.Linq.Enumerable.Sum` when called on `shipment.Invoices`. Suspected cause is `shipment.Invoices` being null.
**Files Involved:**
- `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs`
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `EmailShipment` method no longer throws a `NullReferenceException` when `shipment.Invoices` is null.
- The logic correctly handles cases where `shipment.Invoices` might be null or empty.
**Complexity Assessment (VAN):** Level 1 (Direct fix anticipated)
**Implementation Notes:**
- Applied fix to `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs` at line 152.
- Changed `shipment.Invoices.Sum(x => x.TotalsZero)` to `(shipment.Invoices?.Sum(x => x.TotalsZero) ?? 0)`.
- This ensures that if `shipment.Invoices` is null, the expression evaluates to `0`, preventing the `NullReferenceException`.
**Next Step:** Manual testing or integration testing is required to verify the fix in a runtime environment. Transition to REFLECT mode.

[2025-05-07 14:09:00] - ## Task: Debug Error in POUtils.CreatePOEntries

**ID:** TASK_VAN_002
**Status:** Planning
**Priority:** High
**Assigned Mode:** PLAN
**Original Description:** An error "One or more errors occurred" is reported, originating from `AutoBot.POUtils.CreatePOEntries` at line 790 in `AutoBot/POUtils.cs` (stack trace indicates `C:\Insight Software\Autobot-Enterprise.2.0\AutoBot\POUtils.cs:line 790`). The immediate cause is a `throw;` statement within a catch block. The actual error occurs when accessing `.Result` on the task returned by `BaseDataModel.Instance.AddToEntry(...)` on line 783.
**Suspected Cause:** An unhandled exception within the asynchronous operation of `BaseDataModel.Instance.AddToEntry(...)` or `BaseDataModel.Instance.ClearAsycudaDocumentSet(...)` due to blocking calls (`.Result` or `.Wait()`).

**Complexity:**
Level: 2
Type: Bug Fix / Refactor for Robustness

**Technology Stack:**
- Framework: .NET
- Language: C#
- Key Pattern: async/await

**Technology Validation Checkpoints:**
- [ ] Project builds successfully after async/await refactoring.
- [ ] (Conceptual) Error handling behaves as expected (no AggregateExceptions from this specific area, root cause logged).

**Implementation Plan:**

**Goal:** Refactor `POUtils.CreatePOEntries` and its callers to use `async/await` correctly, preventing `AggregateException` and ensuring proper error propagation and handling.

**Files to Modify (Primary):**
- `AutoBot/POUtils.cs` (and its partial class components like `AutoBot/POUtils/CreatePOEntries.cs`, `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreatePOEntries_Overload2.cs`, `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreateLatestPOEntries.cs`)
- Potentially `AutoBot/FileUtils.cs` and further up the call stack.

**Files to Investigate (Secondary):**
- `WaterNut.Business.Services/Custom Services/DataModels/Custom DataModels/BaseBusinessLayerDS.cs` (methods `AddToEntry`, `ClearAsycudaDocumentSet`, and methods they call).

**Detailed Steps:**
1.  **Refactor `POUtils.CreatePOEntries(int docSetId, List<int> entrylst)` to `async Task<List<DocumentCT>>`:**
    *   Locate definition (likely in `AutoBot/POUtils/CreatePOEntries.cs` or `AutoBot/POUtils.cs`).
    *   Change signature: `public static async Task<List<DocumentCT>> CreatePOEntries(int docSetId, List<int> entrylst)`
    *   Modify calls within:
        *   `await BaseDataModel.Instance.ClearAsycudaDocumentSet((int)docSetId).ConfigureAwait(false);`
        *   `return await BaseDataModel.Instance.AddToEntry(entrylst, docSetId, ..., false).ConfigureAwait(false);`
    *   Adjust `catch (Exception ex)` block: It will now catch the direct exception, not `AggregateException`. Logging/emailing `ex` directly is more informative.
2.  **Refactor `POUtils.RecreatePOEntries(int asycudaDocumentSetId)` to `async Task`:**
    *   Locate definition (in `AutoBot/POUtils.cs`).
    *   Change signature: `public static async Task RecreatePOEntries(int asycudaDocumentSetId)`
    *   Modify call within loop: `await CreatePOEntries(docSetId.DocSetId, docSetId.Entrylst).ConfigureAwait(false);`
    *   Adjust `catch (Exception ex)` block.
3.  **Investigate and Refactor Other Direct Callers of `CreatePOEntries(int, List<int>)`:**
    *   Examine `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreatePOEntries_Overload2.cs` and `AutoBot/POUtils/RecreateLatestPOEntries.cs`.
    *   Apply similar `async/await` refactoring to the calling methods within these files.
4.  **Propagate `async/await` Up the Call Stack:**
    *   The original stack trace included `AutoBot.FileUtils.<>c.<get_FileActions>b__1_7`. This lambda and the method it's part of (`get_FileActions` in `FileUtils.cs`) will likely need to become `async` and `await` the call to `RecreatePOEntries` (or the relevant refactored method).
    *   Continue this propagation as far as is reasonable or until an appropriate point where the async operation can be handled (e.g., an event handler in a UI, an API controller endpoint).
5.  **Testing (Conceptual):**
    *   Verify the application builds successfully.
    *   If possible, manually trigger the code path that previously caused the error.
    *   Confirm that if an error occurs within `AddToEntry` or `ClearAsycudaDocumentSet`, it's logged/reported without an `AggregateException` at the `POUtils` level, and the application handles it more gracefully.

**Creative Phases Required:**
- N/A (This is a bug fix and refactoring task)

**Dependencies:**
- Understanding of C# `async/await` patterns.
- Access to the codebase for `AutoBot` and `WaterNut.Business.Services`.

**Challenges & Mitigations:**
- **Async Propagation Scope:** The `async/await` changes might need to go far up the call stack.
    - **Mitigation:** Address this iteratively. Start with the core methods and expand. If it becomes too large for a Level 2, re-assess.
- **Understanding Business Logic:** The exact cause of failure within `AddToEntry` or `ClearAsycudaDocumentSet` is still unknown. The primary goal here is to fix the *handling* of such errors.
    - **Mitigation:** Focus on robust error propagation. A separate task might be needed to debug the root cause within those methods if it's complex.
- **Version/Path Mismatch:** The `Autobot-Enterprise.2.0` path in the stack trace.
    - **Mitigation:** Proceed with changes in the current workspace. If errors persist, this discrepancy will need investigation. Assume current workspace is canonical for now.

**Status:**
- [X] Initialization complete (VAN)
- [ ] Planning complete
- [ ] Technology validation complete
- [ ] Implementation steps

[2025-05-09 10:51:04] - ## New Task: Create Unit Test for GetTariffCode

**ID:** TASK_VAN_003
**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** Medium
**Assigned Mode:** VAN
**Request:** Create a unit test for the `GetTariffCode` method in `WaterNut.Business.Services\Custom Services\InventoryQS\InventoryItemsExService.cs`. The test should use "61091000" as the input parameter and be located in the `AutoBotUtilities.Tests` project.
**Files Involved:**
- `WaterNut.Business.Services\Custom Services\InventoryQS\InventoryItemsExService.cs` (method to be tested)
- A new test file or an existing one within `AutoBotUtilities.Tests` project.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A new unit test for `GetTariffCode` is created.
- The test passes when `GetTariffCode` behaves as expected with the input "61091000".
- The test is located in the `C:\Insight Software\AutoBot-Enterprise\AutoBotUtilities.Tests` project.
**Complexity Assessment (VAN):** Level 1 (Straightforward unit test creation)
[2025-05-09 10:53:47] - 
**Implementation Notes (TASK_VAN_003):**
- Created unit test file `AutoBotUtilities.Tests/InventoryItemsExServiceTests.cs`.
- Used NUnit framework as per existing project setup.
- Added test cases for input "61091000", null input, and empty string input.
- Corrected NUnit assertion syntax.
**Status:** Implemented (Testing to be performed by user)

[2025-05-10 12:13:58] - ## New Task: Create Email MCP Server

**Request:** Create an email MCP server based on the EmailDownloader project. Use connection settings from the database `applicationsettings` table.

**Status:** Pending VAN mode analysis.

[2025-05-10 12:16:10] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server
**Status:** VAN mode analysis in progress.
**Action:** Identifying necessary information, starting with database connection settings for email.
**Next Step:** Query `applicationsettings` table once details for retrieving email settings are clarified by the user.

[2025-05-10 12:21:42] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server
**Status:** VAN mode analysis complete.
**Details:** Email credentials retrieved: `documents.websource@auto-brokerage.com` / `WebSource`. Task complexity assessed as Level 2-4.
**Next Step:** Transition to PLAN mode for detailed planning.

[2025-05-10 12:27:14] - ## Implementation Plan: Create Email MCP Server (Level 3)

**Requirements Analysis:**
- Core Requirements:
  - [ ] Create a new MCP server using Node.js and TypeScript.
  - [ ] The server must connect to an email account using IMAP for reading emails.
  - [ ] The server must use the following connection details:
    -   Username: `documents.websource@auto-brokerage.com`
    -   Password: `WebSource`
    -   Incoming Server (IMAP): `mail.auto-brokerage.com`
    -   IMAP Port: 993 (SSL/TLS)
    -   (Optional for future) Outgoing Server (SMTP): `mail.auto-brokerage.com`
    -   (Optional for future) SMTP Port: 465 (SSL/TLS)
  - [ ] The server should expose MCP tools to:
    -   List emails (e.g., from INBOX, with optional filters for date, sender, subject).
    -   Fetch the content (body, headers) of a specific email.
    -   Download attachments from a specific email.
  - [ ] The server should draw inspiration and potentially adapt logic from the existing `EmailDownloader` C# project.
  - [ ] Credentials must be configurable via environment variables passed by the MCP host.
- Technical Constraints:
  - [ ] Must use the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
  - [ ] Server to be created in the standard MCP directory: `C:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Roo-Code\MCP`.
  - [ ] Error handling must be robust, providing clear messages for connection issues or operational failures.

**Component Analysis:**
- **Email MCP Server Project (New):**
  - Type: Node.js/TypeScript application.
  - Location: `C:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Roo-Code\MCP\email-mcp-server` (tentative name).
  - Changes needed: Full implementation.
  - Dependencies: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, an IMAP client library (e.g., `imapflow`), potentially a MIME parsing library.
- **Email Client Library (e.g., `imapflow`):**
  - Purpose: Handle IMAP connection, authentication, email fetching, and parsing.
  - Changes needed: Integration into the MCP server.
  - Dependencies: Node.js environment.
- **`mcp_settings.json`:**
  - Location: `c:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\globalStorage\rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline\settings\mcp_settings.json`.
  - Changes needed: Add a new server entry for the email MCP server, including command, args, and environment variables for email credentials and server details.
  - Dependencies: Correct JSON formatting.

**Architecture Considerations (Design Decisions):**
- **MCP Tool Design:**
  - `list_emails`:
    - Input: `mailbox` (string, default: 'INBOX'), `criteria` (object, optional, e.g., `{ since: 'YYYY-MM-DD', from: 'sender@example.com', subjectContains: 'keyword' }`), `limit` (number, optional, default: 20).
    - Output: Array of email objects (e.g., `{ uid: string, subject: string, from: string, date: string, hasAttachments: boolean }`).
  - `get_email_details`:
    - Input: `mailbox` (string, default: 'INBOX'), `uid` (string, required).
    - Output: Email detail object (e.g., `{ uid: string, subject: string, from: string, to: string[], cc: string[], date: string, bodyText: string, bodyHtml: string, attachments: [{ filename: string, size: number, contentType: string, id: string }] }`).
  - `download_attachment`:
    - Input: `mailbox` (string, default: 'INBOX'), `uid` (string, required), `attachmentId` (string, required), `downloadPath` (string, required - path where Cline should suggest saving).
    - Output: Confirmation or file stream (MCP SDK specific handling for file content).
- **Authentication:** Credentials (`Email`, `EmailPassword`) and server details (`IMAP_HOST`, `IMAP_PORT`) will be passed as environment variables to the MCP server process, configured in `mcp_settings.json`.
- **Error Handling:** Implement try-catch blocks for all I/O operations (email server communication). Return structured `McpError` objects for failures.
- **Modularity:** Separate email interaction logic from MCP request handling logic.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Phase 1: Project Setup & Technology Validation**
    - [x] Use `npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server email-mcp-server` in `C:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Roo-Code\MCP`. (Completed in PLAN)

    - [x] Implement function to fetch full email structure (headers, body, attachments list) by UID. (Implemented in `index.ts`)
    - [x] Implement function to stream an attachment's content. (Implemented in `index.ts` as base64 content)
    - [x] Ensure robust error handling and logging for these core functions. (Implemented in `index.ts`)
3.  **Phase 3: MCP Tool Implementation**
    - [x] Implement the `list_emails` MCP tool, mapping input parameters to `imapflow` search criteria. (Implemented in `index.ts`, includes `list_mailboxes`)
    - [x] Implement the `get_email_details` MCP tool, fetching and parsing email content. (Implemented in `index.ts`)
    - [x] Implement the `download_attachment` MCP tool. (Implemented in `index.ts`)
    - [x] Define input and output schemas for each tool. (Implemented in `index.ts`)
4.  **Phase 4: Configuration & Build**
    - [x] Modify the MCP server to read email credentials and server settings from `process.env`. (Completed in PLAN)
    - [x] Update `package.json` build script if necessary. (Completed in PLAN)
    - [x] Build the server (`npm run build`). (Completed in PLAN)
    - [x] Prepare the entry for `mcp_settings.json`. (Completed in PLAN)

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests (Optional but Recommended):**
  - [ ] For utility functions (e.g., criteria mapping, email data transformation). Mock the email client library.
- **Integration/Manual Tests:**
  - [ ] Test `list_emails` tool with various criteria.
  - [ ] Test `get_email_details` for emails with and without attachments, different body types.
  - [ ] Test `download_attachment` for various file types.
  - [ ] Test error handling (e.g., invalid credentials, server down - if possible to simulate).
  - [ ] All testing will be done by invoking tools via Cline after configuring the server.

**Documentation Plan:**
- [ ] Update `tasks.md` with this completed plan.
- [ ] Add brief notes on how to use the new MCP tools in `activeContext.md` or a new `email-mcp-server-usage.md` in the memory bank upon completion.

**Technology Stack:**
- Framework: Node.js
- Language: TypeScript
- Build Tool: `tsc`, `npm scripts`
- Key Libraries: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `imapflow` (for IMAP), `mailparser` (if `imapflow` doesn't provide sufficient parsing).
- Storage: N/A (server is stateless, email data resides on the mail server).

**Technology Validation Checkpoints:**
- [ ] Project initialization command (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server email-mcp-server`) verified.
- [ ] Required dependencies (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `imapflow`) identified and can be installed.
- [ ] Build configuration (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json` scripts) validated.
- [ ] "Hello world" MCP tool (e.g., a simple echo tool) runs successfully.
- [ ] Test build passes successfully.
- [ ] Basic IMAP connection to `mail.auto-brokerage.com:993` with `imapflow` is successful (can be a separate test script initially).

**Creative Phases Required:**
- [ ] N/A (Standard email client functionality, no novel algorithms or complex UI/Arch design expected for core features).

**Dependencies:**
- Access to the `EmailDownloader` C# project for logic reference.
- Node.js (v16+) and npm installed on the system.
- Network access to `mail.auto-brokerage.com` on port 993.

**Challenges & Mitigations:**
- **Challenge:** Complexity in adapting logic from C# `EmailDownloader` to TypeScript/Node.js.
  - **Mitigation:** Focus on understanding the core IMAP operations in `EmailDownloader` rather than a direct port. Implement features incrementally.
- **Challenge:** Email server specific behaviors or IMAP command interpretations.
  - **Mitigation:** Rely on a well-maintained library like `imapflow`. Test thoroughly against the target server.
- **Challenge:** Handling diverse email structures and MIME types.
  - **Mitigation:** Use `mailparser` or similar robust library if `imapflow`'s built-in parsing is insufficient. Start with common cases and expand if needed.
- **Challenge:** Ensuring secure handling of credentials (even if passed via env vars).
  - **Mitigation:** The MCP framework handles the env var injection. The server code itself should not log credentials.

**Status:**
- [X] Initialization complete (VAN)
- [X] Planning complete (PLAN)
- [ ] Technology validation pending
- [ ] Implementation steps pending

[2025-05-10 12:41:08] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server - Technology Validation Progress

**Phase:** Technology Validation (PLAN Mode)

**Technology Validation Checkpoints Status:**
- [X] Project initialization command (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server email-mcp-server`) verified.
- [X] Required dependencies (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `imapflow`, `mailparser`, `@types/imapflow`) identified and installed.
- [X] Build configuration (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json` scripts) validated (project builds successfully).
- [X] Test build passes successfully.
- [ ] "Hello world" MCP tool runs successfully (Awaiting MCP server reload and confirmation).
- [ ] Basic IMAP connection to `mail.auto-brokerage.com:993` with `imapflow` is successful (Awaiting MCP server reload and log review from `testImapConnection()` output).

**Next Step:** Review MCP server status and logs in the next system update to confirm the remaining checkpoints. Update `mcp_settings.json` has been completed.

[2025-05-10 12:43:27] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server - Technology Validation Results

**Phase:** Technology Validation (PLAN Mode)

**Technology Validation Checkpoints Status:**
- [X] Project initialization command (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server email-mcp-server`) verified.
- [X] Required dependencies (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `imapflow`, `mailparser`, `@types/imapflow`) identified and installed.
- [X] Build configuration (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json` scripts) validated (project builds successfully).
- [X] Test build passes successfully.
- [X] "Hello world" MCP tool runs successfully (Server connected, tool available).
- [ ] Basic IMAP connection to `mail.auto-brokerage.com:993` with `imapflow` is successful (Connection to IMAP server established, but login for `documents.websource@auto-brokerage.com` failed with error: "Login disabled.").

**Issue:** The IMAP server `mail.auto-brokerage.com` is rejecting the login attempt for the provided credentials with the message "Login disabled." This prevents full validation of the email functionality.

**Next Step:** User needs to investigate the "Login disabled" issue for the email account `documents.websource@auto-brokerage.com`. Technology validation cannot be fully completed until IMAP login is successful.

[2025-05-10 12:53:05] - ## Update on Task: Create Email MCP Server - Technology Validation Re-test

**Phase:** Technology Validation (PLAN Mode)

**Action:** User requested changing the email address for IMAP test to `websource@auto-brokerage.com` (password remains `WebSource`).
- Updated `C:\Users\josep\AppData\Roaming\Roo-Code\MCP\email-mcp-server\src\index.ts` with the new email for `testImapConnection()`.

## Implementation Plan (Level 2)

**Overview of Changes:**
This plan outlines the steps to build the `AutoBot-Enterprise` solution and then identify and fix asynchronous programming issues within the `EmailDownloader` and `AutoBot1` (specifically `AutoBot.csproj`) projects. The goal is to ensure the solution builds successfully and that async operations in the specified projects are correctly implemented to avoid deadlocks, improve performance, and enhance error handling.

**Files to Modify (Potential - based on async issue investigation):**
- `EmailDownloader/EmailDownLoader.cs`
- `EmailDownloader/Client.cs` (if async calls originate or are handled here)
- `AutoBot1/Program.cs`
- `AutoBot1/FolderProcessor.cs` (if it contains async logic)
- Other `.cs` files within `EmailDownloader` and `AutoBot1` projects as identified during the investigation.

**Technology Stack:**
- Framework: .NET Framework 4.8 (as per BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Language: C#
- Build Tool: MSBuild (via Visual Studio 2022)
- Key Pattern: async/await

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Build the Entire Solution:**
    *   Execute the build command from `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:
        ```powershell
        & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" AutoBot-Enterprise.sln /t:Clean,Restore,Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
        ```
    *   Analyze build output for any initial errors. Resolve critical build failures across the solution if they prevent focused work on target projects. (Note: Task is to *fix only* EmailDownloader and AutoBot1 async issues, but a baseline build is needed).
2.  **Investigate Async Issues in `EmailDownloader` Project:**
    *   Review code in `EmailDownloader.cs` and other relevant files for `async/await` usage.
    *   Look for common anti-patterns: `async void`, `.Result`, `.Wait()`, incorrect `ConfigureAwait(false)` usage, lack of error handling in async methods.
    *   Identify specific areas needing refactoring.
3.  **Fix Async Issues in `EmailDownloader` Project:**
    *   Apply necessary code changes to implement `async/await` correctly.
    *   Ensure proper exception handling for async operations.
    *   Rebuild the `EmailDownloader.csproj` project specifically to check for compilation errors:
        ```powershell
        & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" "EmailDownloader\EmailDownloader.csproj" /t:Clean,Restore,Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
        ```
4.  **Investigate Async Issues in `AutoBot1` Project (`AutoBot.csproj`):**
    *   Review code in `Program.cs`, `FolderProcessor.cs`, and other relevant files for `async/await` usage.
    *   Look for similar anti-patterns as in `EmailDownloader`.
    *   Identify specific areas needing refactoring.
5.  **Fix Async Issues in `AutoBot1` Project:**
    *   Apply necessary code changes.
    *   Ensure proper exception handling.
    *   Rebuild the `AutoBot1/AutoBot.csproj` project specifically:
        ```powershell
        & "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" "AutoBot1\AutoBot.csproj" /t:Clean,Restore,Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
        ```
6.  **Final Solution Rebuild and Verification:**
    *   Rebuild the entire `AutoBot-Enterprise.sln` again to ensure no new issues were introduced.
    *   Perform basic smoke testing if possible/applicable for the affected async functionalities (e.g., if EmailDownloader has a test console or a simple trigger mechanism).

**Potential Challenges:**
-   **Cascading Async Changes:** Refactoring one async method might require changes up the call stack, potentially outside the initially scoped projects. The plan is to focus fixes *within* `EmailDownloader` and `AutoBot1`, but awareness of wider impact is needed.
-   **Build Failures in Unrelated Projects:** The initial full solution build might reveal errors in other projects. These should be noted but not fixed unless they block the primary task.
-   **Lack of Unit Tests:** Identifying the impact of async refactoring might be difficult without existing unit tests for the affected components.
-   **Understanding Existing Logic:** Complex existing codebases can make it challenging to refactor async patterns without unintended side effects.

**Testing Strategy:**
-   **Build Verification:** Successful compilation of individual projects and the entire solution is the primary verification method for this task's scope.
-   **Code Review:** Review refactored async code for correctness and adherence to best practices.
-   **Manual Smoke Testing (Limited):** If entry points for the modified async operations are easily accessible (e.g., a console app start, a specific UI action that can be manually triggered if `AutoBot1` is part of a larger runnable system), perform a quick test to see if the core functionality still works and doesn't hang or throw obvious new errors.
-   **Focus on Build Success:** The main goal is to fix build issues related to async and ensure the specified projects build cleanly with correct async patterns.

**Technology Validation Checkpoints:**
- [ ] .NET Framework 4.8 and C# are the correct technologies for the target projects.
- [ ] MSBuild command from `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` is valid and executable.
- [ ] `async/await` patterns are applicable and the standard approach for the identified issues.
- [ ] Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise is the assumed development environment.

### Investigation Area 1: Connection Leaks

**Sub-Task ID:** VAN-20250511-191130-RCA-01

**Objective:** To confirm or refute whether improper disposal of `DbContext` or `SqlConnection` objects is leading to connection pool exhaustion.

**Methodology:**
1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Identify all code paths where `DbContext` (specifically `WaterNut.Data.WaterNutDBEntities` or similar based on stack trace) and `SqlConnection` objects are created and used.
    *   Pay close attention to the methods identified in the stack trace: [`SaveSql`](C:\\Insight%20Software\\Autobot-Enterprise.2.0\\WaterNut.Business.Services\\Custom%20Services\\DataModels\\Custom%20DataModels\\Asycuda\\SavingAllocations\\SaveAllocationSQL.cs:148), [`SaveAllocations`](C:\\Insight%20Software\\Autobot-Enterprise.2.0\\WaterNut.Business.Services\\Custom%20Services\\DataModels\\Custom%20DataModels\\Asycuda\\SavingAllocations\\SaveAllocationSQL.cs:68), [`GetXcudaInventoryItems`](C:\\Insight%20Software\\Autobot-Enterprise.2.0\\WaterNut.Business.Services\\Custom%20Services\\DataModels\\Custom%20DataModels\\Asycuda\\GettingXcudaInventoryItems\\GetXcudaInventoryItems.cs:14), and their callers.
    *   Verify that `DbContext` instances are scoped appropriately (e.g., per request, per unit of work) and consistently disposed of, preferably using `using` statements.
        ```csharp
        // Example of correct usage
        using (var context = new YourDbContext()) 
        { 
            // ... operations ... 
        }
        ```
    *   Check for any static `DbContext` or `SqlConnection` instances that are not managed correctly.
    *   Ensure connections opened manually are closed in `finally` blocks or via `using` statements.
2.  **Performance Counter Monitoring (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Monitor `.NET Data Provider for SqlServer` performance counters on the application server, specifically:
        *   `NumberOfPooledConnections`: Should ideally stabilize and not grow indefinitely under consistent load.
        *   `NumberOfActiveConnections`: Should reflect actual ongoing database operations and return to a baseline.
        *   `NumberOfFreeConnections`: Should be available in the pool.
        *   `NumberOfReclaimedConnections`: A high number might indicate connections being forcefully reclaimed due to not being closed properly (though this is less common for true leaks and more for connections held too long).
    *   Monitor these counters during idle, normal, and peak load periods.
3.  **Memory Profiling (Dynamic Analysis - if necessary):**
    *   If code review and performance counters are inconclusive, use a .NET memory profiler.
    *   Profile the application under load, looking for `DbContext` or `SqlConnection` objects that are not being garbage collected as expected, potentially held by static references or incorrect event handler subscriptions.
4.  **SQL Server Connection Monitoring (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Use `sp_who2` or query `sys.dm_exec_sessions` and `sys.dm_exec_connections` on SQL Server. Look for connections from the application that remain in an idle state (`status = 'sleeping'`, `last_request_end_time` is old) for extended periods without being reused or closed. Correlate `host_process_id` with the application's process ID.

**Tools & Commands:**
*   IDE for code review (e.g., Visual Studio).
*   Windows Performance Monitor (`perfmon.exe`).
*   SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): `sp_who2`, `SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions WHERE program_name = 'YourApplicationName';`
*   (Optional) .NET Memory Profiler.

**Evidence to Gather:**
*   Relevant code snippets showing `DbContext`/`SqlConnection` instantiation, usage, and disposal (or lack thereof).
*   Screenshots or logs from Performance Monitor showing connection pool counter trends.
*   Results from `sp_who2` or `sys.dm_exec_sessions` showing potentially leaked/idle connections.
*   (If used) Memory profiler snapshots and analysis reports.

**Verification/Determination Criteria:**
*   **Confirmed if:** Code review reveals clear patterns of non-disposal (missing `using`, no `Close()`/`Dispose()` in `finally`), AND/OR performance counters show `NumberOfPooledConnections` growing without bound under sustained load and not returning to baseline after load, AND/OR `sys.dm_exec_sessions` shows a large number of old, sleeping connections from the application.
*   **Refuted if:** All `DbContext`/`SqlConnection` instances are correctly disposed of via `using` or explicit `Dispose()` in all relevant code paths, and connection pool counters behave as expected (stabilize, connections are reused).

--- 

### Investigation Area 2: Long-Running Queries/Transactions

**Sub-Task ID:** VAN-20250511-191130-RCA-02

**Objective:** To identify if specific database queries or transactions are taking an excessive amount of time, thereby holding connections and contributing to pool exhaustion.

**Methodology:**
1.  **SQL Server Profiler/Extended Events (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Configure a trace to capture: `RPC:Completed`, `SQL:BatchCompleted`, `SQL:StmtCompleted`, `SP:Completed` events.
    *   Filter by `ApplicationName` (if set in connection string) or `HostName`.
    *   Include columns: `Duration`, `CPU`, `Reads`, `Writes`, `TextData`, `StartTime`, `EndTime`, `DatabaseName`, `LoginName`.
    *   Run this trace during periods when timeouts are observed or under simulated load.
    *   Analyze the trace for queries with high `Duration`. Pay attention to queries originating from the methods in the error stack trace.
2.  **SQL Server Activity Monitor / DMVs (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Use SSMS Activity Monitor to check for "Recent Expensive Queries" and "Active Expensive Queries".
    *   Query `sys.dm_exec_query_stats`, `sys.dm_exec_sql_text`, `sys.dm_exec_query_plan` for historical query performance data. Sort by `total_elapsed_time`, `avg_elapsed_time`, `total_logical_reads`.
        ```sql
        SELECT TOP 50
            qs.execution_count,
            qs.total_elapsed_time / 1000000.0 AS total_elapsed_time_seconds,
            qs.total_elapsed_time / qs.execution_count / 1000.0 AS avg_elapsed_time_ms,
            qs.total_logical_reads, 
            qs.total_logical_writes,
            SUBSTRING(st.text, (qs.statement_start_offset/2)+1, 
                ((CASE qs.statement_end_offset
                    WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(st.text)
                    ELSE qs.statement_end_offset
                    END - qs.statement_start_offset)/2) + 1) AS statement_text,
            qp.query_plan
        FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats AS qs
        CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) AS st
        CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_query_plan(qs.plan_handle) AS qp
        ORDER BY qs.total_elapsed_time DESC; 
        ```
3.  **Transaction Monitoring (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Query `sys.dm_tran_active_transactions`, `sys.dm_tran_session_transactions`, and `sys.dm_tran_locks` to identify long-running open transactions and potential blocking.
    *   If Entity Framework is used, ensure `TransactionScope` (if used) has appropriate timeout settings and is completed/disposed promptly.
4.  **Execution Plan Analysis (Static/Dynamic):**
    *   For identified slow queries, obtain their execution plans (Actual Execution Plan from SSMS or from DMVs/Profiler).
    *   Look for table scans, key lookups, missing indexes, implicit conversions, or other inefficiencies.
5.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Review the C# code that generates these long-running queries or manages these transactions (e.g., the `SaveSql` method executing raw SQL, or EF queries in `GetXcudaInventoryItems`).
    *   Check for loops performing multiple database calls that could be batched, or inefficient LINQ queries that translate to poor SQL.

**Tools & Commands:**
*   SQL Server Profiler or Extended Events.
*   SQL Server Management Studio (Activity Monitor, Query Editor for DMVs).
*   IDE for code review.

**Evidence to Gather:**
*   Profiler/Extended Events trace files or summaries highlighting long-running queries.
*   Output from DMV queries showing expensive queries and active transactions.
*   Execution plans for problematic queries.
*   Relevant C# code snippets generating the queries or managing transactions.

**Verification/Determination Criteria:**
*   **Confirmed if:** Profiler/DMVs consistently show queries/transactions with durations significant enough to hold connections for extended periods (e.g., > few seconds, depending on application tolerance and load) especially during timeout incidents. Execution plans reveal clear optimization opportunities.
*   **Refuted if:** All queries and transactions execute quickly, and no significant blocking or long-held locks are observed.

### Investigation Area 3: High Application Load

**Sub-Task ID:** VAN-20250511-191130-RCA-03

**Objective:** To determine if legitimate high application demand is overwhelming the configured connection pool capacity or database server resources.

**Methodology:**
1.  **Application Performance Metrics Monitoring (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Monitor key application server metrics (e.g., via Performance Monitor, APM tool, IIS logs):
        *   Requests/sec (Web Applications).
        *   Request Queue Length.
        *   CPU Utilization.
        *   Memory Utilization.
    *   Correlate these with database connection pool counters (`NumberOfActiveConnections`, `NumberOfPooledConnections`).
2.  **Connection Pool Statistics Monitoring (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Monitor `.NET Data Provider for SqlServer` counters:
        *   `NumberOfActiveConnections` vs. `MaxPoolSize` (from connection string, default 100).
        *   `NumberOfFreeConnections`: Should not be consistently zero under load if the pool is healthy.
        *   `ConnectionPoolOpenCount` / `ConnectionPoolCloseCount`.
        *   `NumberOfStasisConnections` (connections waiting for creation because pool is busy).
3.  **Database Server Resource Monitoring (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Monitor SQL Server performance counters:
        *   `SQLServer:General Statistics\User Connections`.
        *   `Process\% Processor Time` (for `sqlservr.exe`).
        *   `Memory\Available MBytes`.
        *   `PhysicalDisk\% Idle Time` (for disks hosting data/log files).
        *   `SQLServer:SQL Statistics\Batch Requests/sec`.
4.  **Load Testing (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   If possible, conduct controlled load tests simulating realistic peak user activity.
    *   Gradually increase the load while monitoring all the above metrics.
    *   Identify the point at which connection timeouts start occurring and correlate with pool/server metrics.

**Tools & Commands:**
*   Windows Performance Monitor (`perfmon.exe`) on application and DB servers.
*   IIS Logs analyzer (if web application).
*   SQL Server Management Studio (DMVs, Activity Monitor).
*   (Optional) Load testing tools (e.g., Apache JMeter, k6, Azure Load Testing).
*   (Optional) APM tool.

**Evidence to Gather:**
*   Time-series data/graphs of application performance metrics.
*   Time-series data/graphs of connection pool counters, especially `NumberOfActiveConnections` approaching `MaxPoolSize`.
*   Time-series data/graphs of database server resource utilization.
*   Load testing results, if performed, showing throughput, error rates, and resource usage at different load levels.

**Verification/Determination Criteria:**
*   **Confirmed if:** `NumberOfActiveConnections` consistently hits or stays very close to `MaxPoolSize` during peak load or when errors occur, AND `NumberOfFreeConnections` is zero or very low, AND application request rates are high, AND database server resources (CPU, memory, I/O) are not already saturated (implying the pool itself is the bottleneck, not necessarily the server's ability to handle more if the pool were larger or connections processed faster).
*   **Refuted if:** `NumberOfActiveConnections` remains well below `MaxPoolSize` when errors occur, OR if database server resources are clearly exhausted before the pool limit is reached (pointing to a DB server bottleneck instead).

### Investigation Area 4: Inefficient Data Access Patterns

**Sub-Task ID:** VAN-20250511-191130-RCA-04

**Objective:** To identify and quantify issues like N+1 query problems, retrieval of excessive data, or extensive row-by-row processing that could lead to prolonged connection usage or high connection churn.

**Methodology:**
1.  **ORM Logging/Profiling (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Enable Entity Framework logging to see the generated SQL queries. `DbContext.Database.Log = Console.Write;` (or a custom logger).
    *   Use tools like EF Profiler (commercial), MiniProfiler (open-source), or an APM tool with ORM insight.
    *   Look for patterns where multiple similar queries are executed in a loop (N+1 selects).
    *   Analyze the volume of data being retrieved by queries – are all columns/rows necessary?
2.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Focus on data access layers and methods interacting with `DbContext`.
    *   Look for loops that iterate over a collection and perform a database query inside the loop for each item.
        ```csharp
        // Example of N+1
        var orders = context.Orders.ToList();
        foreach (var order in orders)
        {
            order.Customer = context.Customers.Single(c => c.Id == order.CustomerId); // N+1 query
        }
        ```
    *   Check for use of `Include()` (for eager loading) or explicit projection (`Select(x => new { ... })`) to avoid N+1 and over-fetching.
    *   Identify any row-by-row processing (RBAR - Row By Agonizing Row) that involves database calls within the loop, especially for updates or inserts that could be batched.
3.  **SQL Profiling (Dynamic Analysis - Correlated with Code):**
    *   Use SQL Profiler/Extended Events traces captured in Area 2. Correlate sequences of queries with specific application code paths to identify N+1 patterns or inefficient data retrieval logic.

**Tools & Commands:**
*   Entity Framework logging mechanisms.
*   (Optional) EF Profiler, MiniProfiler, APM tools.
*   SQL Server Profiler / Extended Events.
*   IDE for code review.

**Evidence to Gather:**
*   EF logs showing generated SQL, especially repeated queries.
*   Profiler traces demonstrating N+1 query patterns.
*   Code snippets exhibiting N+1 behavior or RBAR processing.
*   Metrics from APM tools quantifying the impact of inefficient patterns.

**Verification/Determination Criteria:**
*   **Confirmed if:** Clear evidence of N+1 query patterns is found (many small, similar queries executed in rapid succession corresponding to a loop in code), OR if queries are found to retrieve significantly more data than necessary for the operation, OR if row-by-row processing involving database calls is prevalent for bulk operations. These patterns would contribute to longer connection holding times or higher frequency of connection requests.
*   **Refuted if:** Data access patterns primarily use eager loading (`Include`), projections, or batch operations where appropriate, and N+1 issues are minimal or non-existent in critical paths.

### Investigation Area 5: Connection Pool Misconfiguration

**Sub-Task ID:** VAN-20250511-191130-RCA-05

**Objective:** To evaluate if the current ADO.NET connection pool settings are appropriate for the application's load profile and database capabilities.

**Methodology:**
1.  **Identify Connection String:**
    *   Locate the SQL Server connection string used by the application. This is typically in `web.config`, `app.config`, or could be constructed in code. The stack trace mentions `WaterNut.Business.Services`, so configuration might be within that project or a consuming application.
2.  **Review Connection Pool Settings:**
    *   Examine the connection string for explicit pool settings: `Max Pool Size`, `Min Pool Size`, `Connect Timeout`, `Connection Lifetime`, `Load Balance Timeout`.
    *   Note default values if settings are not present (e.g., `Max Pool Size` default is 100, `Min Pool Size` default is 0, `Connect Timeout` default is 15 seconds).
3.  **Compare with Observed Load & Performance:**
    *   Relate `MaxPoolSize` to the `NumberOfActiveConnections` observed during peak load (from Area 3). Is the max size being hit frequently?
    *   Consider `MinPoolSize`: If set too high for periods of low activity, it might keep unnecessary connections open. If too low (or 0), there might be a slight ramp-up cost for new connections during sudden load spikes.
    *   `Connect Timeout`: Is the default 15 seconds (or configured value) sufficient for establishing a new connection, especially if the network or DB server is occasionally slow? The error message itself is a timeout *waiting for a connection from the pool*, not establishing a new one, but related timeouts can interact.
    *   `Connection Lifetime`: If set, connections are destroyed and recreated after this period. This can help with issues like load balancing or stale connections but can also add overhead if too short.

**Tools & Commands:**
*   File viewer/editor for configuration files.
*   Application source code viewer (if connection string is built in code).

**Evidence to Gather:**
*   The active SQL Server connection string(s).
*   List of configured vs. default connection pool settings.
*   Data from Area 3 (High Application Load) regarding `NumberOfActiveConnections` relative to `MaxPoolSize`.

**Verification/Determination Criteria:**
*   **Confirmed as a contributing factor if:**
        *   `MaxPoolSize` is demonstrably too low for the observed peak load (i.e., consistently hitting the limit while the DB server still has capacity).
        *   `Connect Timeout` is extremely short and there's evidence of intermittent network slowness in establishing *new* connections (though the primary error is about getting one *from* the pool).
        *   Other settings like `Connection Lifetime` are set to unusually aggressive values causing excessive churn.
*   **Refuted if:** Default settings are in use and seem reasonable, or custom settings are well-justified and do not appear to be the primary constraint based on load data.

### Investigation Area 6: Network Latency/Instability

**Sub-Task ID:** VAN-20250511-191130-RCA-06

**Objective:** To determine if network issues between the application server(s) and the database server are causing delays or failures in establishing or maintaining connections.

**Methodology:**
1.  **Basic Network Connectivity Tests:**
    *   From the application server, use `ping <database_server_ip_or_hostname>` to check basic reachability and round-trip time (RTT).
    *   Use `tracert <database_server_ip_or_hostname>` (Windows) or `traceroute` (Linux) to identify the network path and potential points of delay.
    *   Use `pathping <database_server_ip_or_hostname>` (Windows) for a more detailed analysis of packet loss along the route over a period.
2.  **Sustained Network Monitoring:**
    *   If intermittent issues are suspected, run sustained pings or use network monitoring tools over a longer period, especially during times when application errors occur.
    *   Monitor for packet loss and significant RTT variations.
3.  **Firewall/Security Group Review:**
    *   Verify that firewalls (Windows Firewall on app/DB server, network firewalls, cloud security groups) are correctly configured to allow traffic on the SQL Server port (default 1433 TCP/UDP) between the application and database servers.
    *   Check firewall logs for any dropped packets related to this communication.
4.  **Network Interface Card (NIC) Health:**
    *   Check NIC statistics on both application and database servers for errors, discards, or high utilization (e.g., via Performance Monitor `Network Interface` counters or OS-specific commands like `netstat -e` on Windows).
5.  **DNS Resolution:**
    *   Ensure DNS resolution for the database server hostname is fast and reliable from the application server.

**Tools & Commands:**
*   `ping`
*   `tracert` / `traceroute`
*   `pathping`
*   `nslookup` or `Resolve-DnsName` (PowerShell)
*   Firewall configuration tools/logs.
*   Performance Monitor (`Network Interface` counters).
*   (Optional) Wireshark or other packet capture tools for deep analysis if severe issues are suspected.

**Evidence to Gather:**
*   Output from `ping`, `tracert`, `pathping` commands.
*   Screenshots of firewall rules.
*   Firewall logs (if relevant drops are found).
*   Network interface statistics.

**Verification/Determination Criteria:**
*   **Confirmed as a contributing factor if:** Consistent high RTT (> acceptable threshold, e.g., >50-100ms for LAN, varies for WAN), significant packet loss (>1-2%), or intermittent connectivity failures are observed between the application and database server. Firewall logs show blocked connections.
*   **Refuted if:** Network connectivity is stable, RTT is low, packet loss is negligible, and firewalls are correctly configured.

### Investigation Area 7: Database Server Bottlenecks

**Sub-Task ID:** VAN-20250511-191130-RCA-07

**Objective:** To ascertain if the SQL Server itself is experiencing performance degradation that prevents it from servicing connection requests or queries in a timely manner.

**Methodology:**
1.  **SQL Server Resource Utilization Monitoring (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   **CPU:** Monitor `Process\% Processor Time` for `sqlservr.exe` and overall System CPU. Sustained high CPU (>80-90%) can be an issue.
    *   **Memory:** Monitor `SQLServer:Memory Manager\Total Server Memory (KB)` vs. `Target Server Memory (KB)`, `Memory Grants Pending`, `Available MBytes` on the server. Low available memory or many pending grants indicate memory pressure.
    *   **I/O:** Monitor `PhysicalDisk\Avg. Disk sec/Read`, `Avg. Disk sec/Write`, `Disk Queue Length` for disks hosting data, log, and tempdb files. High latencies or queue lengths indicate I/O bottlenecks.
    *   **Waits Stats:** Query `sys.dm_os_wait_stats` (clearing it periodically or diffing over time) to identify prevalent wait types. Common problematic waits include `PAGEIOLATCH_*`, `WRITELOG`, `LCK_M_*` (locking), `CXPACKET` (parallelism, can be benign or problematic), `RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE` (query memory).
        ```sql
        -- Example: Top waits since last clear or server start
        SELECT TOP 20 wait_type, waiting_tasks_count, wait_time_ms, 
               max_wait_time_ms, signal_wait_time_ms
        FROM sys.dm_os_wait_stats
        WHERE wait_type NOT IN (
            -- Filter out common benign waits
            'BROKER_EVENTHANDLER', 'BROKER_RECEIVE_WAITFOR', 'BROKER_TASK_STOP',

            'QDS_SHUTDOWN_QUEUE', 'REDO_THREAD_PENDING_WORK', 'REQUEST_FOR_DEADLOCK_SEARCH', 
            'RESOURCE_QUEUE', 'SERVER_IDLE_CHECK', 'SLEEP_BPOOL_FLUSH', 'SLEEP_DBSTARTUP', 
            'SLEEP_DCOMSTARTUP', 'SLEEP_MASTERDBREADY', 'SLEEP_MASTERMDREADY', 
            'SLEEP_MASTERUPGRADED', 'SLEEP_MSQLXPSTARTUP', 'SLEEP_SYSTEMTASK', 'SLEEP_TASK',

            'SQLTRACE_BUFFER_FLUSH', 'SQLTRACE_INCREMENTAL_FLUSH_SLEEP', 
            'SQLTRACE_WAIT_ENTRIES', 'WAIT_FOR_RESULTS', 'WAITFOR', 'WAITFOR_TASKSHUTDOWN', 
            'WAIT_XTP_RECOVERY', 'WAIT_XTP_HOST_WAIT', 'WAIT_XTP_OFFLINE_CKPT_NEW_LOG', 
            'WAIT_XTP_CKPT_CLOSE', 'XE_DISPATCHER_JOIN', 'XE_DISPATCHER_WAIT', 
            'XE_TIMER_EVENT'
        )
        ORDER BY wait_time_ms DESC;
        ```
2.  **Locking, Blocking, Deadlocks (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Monitor `sys.dm_tran_locks` for active locks.
    *   Monitor `sys.dm_os_waiting_tasks` for blocked processes (`wait_type` starting with `LCK_M_`).
    *   Use SQL Profiler/Extended Events to trace `Lock:Deadlock` graph events.
    *   Check SQL Server Error Log for deadlock messages.
3.  **TempDB Contention (Dynamic Analysis):**
    *   Monitor `tempdb` usage and contention, especially if heavy use of temporary tables, table variables, or version store is expected. Look for `PAGELATCH_*` waits on `tempdb` pages.
4.  **SQL Server Configuration Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Check `Max Server Memory` and `Min Server Memory` settings.
    *   Check `max degree of parallelism (MAXDOP)` and `cost threshold for parallelism`.
    *   Ensure database auto-growth settings are reasonable (not too small, not percentage-based for large DBs).
    *   Verify database maintenance (index rebuilds/reorgs, statistics updates) is occurring regularly.

**Tools & Commands:**
*   Windows Performance Monitor on DB server.
*   SQL Server Management Studio (Activity Monitor, DMVs, Query Editor).
*   SQL Server Profiler / Extended Events.
*   SQL Server Error Log viewer.

**Evidence to Gather:**
*   Performance counter logs/graphs for CPU, Memory, I/O, Waits on DB server.
*   Output from wait stats queries.
*   Information on blocking sessions and deadlock graphs.
*   SQL Server configuration settings.
*   Database maintenance plan details and history.

**Verification/Determination Criteria:**
*   **Confirmed as a contributing factor if:** Sustained high CPU/Memory/I/O on the DB server, significant blocking/deadlocking, high problematic wait stats (e.g., `RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE`, excessive `PAGEIOLATCH` on data files, `WRITELOG`), or severe `tempdb` contention are observed correlating with application timeout events. Misconfiguration of critical SQL Server settings (e.g., insufficient `Max Server Memory`).
*   **Refuted if:** Database server resources are generally within healthy limits, and no significant waits, blocking, or configuration issues are found.

## REVISED Investigation Plan for Task: Root Cause Analysis of DB Connectivity Errors (ID: VAN-20250511-191130-RCA)

**Date of Revision:** 2025-05-11 19:36
**Reason for Revision:** User request to re-prioritize investigation steps: start with simpler code analysis/changes and database optimizations, test a key process, then proceed to more complex dynamic analysis.

**Revised Overall Investigation Phasing:**

1.  **Phase 1: Initial Code Review, Simple Fixes & Logging Setup**
    *   **Sub-Phase 1.1:** Static Code Review for Connection Management (Potential Leaks - Area 1). Apply straightforward fixes (e.g., ensuring `using` statements for `DbContext`).
    *   **Sub-Phase 1.2:** Static Code Review for Inefficient Data Access Patterns (Obvious N+1, Over-fetching - Area 4). Apply straightforward fixes.
    *   **Sub-Phase 1.3:** Setup/Enhance Application & SQL Server Logging (Supports all areas, addresses Tech Validation item 4).
2.  **Phase 2: Initial Database Optimizations & Baseline Functional Test**
    *   **Sub-Phase 2.1:** Database Index Review & Recalculation (Addresses parts of Area 2 & Area 7).
    *   **Sub-Phase 2.2:** Test Allocation Process (Functional test to gauge impact of initial changes).
3.  **Phase 3: Dynamic Analysis & Deeper Investigation (Iterative, based on Phase 2 results)**
    *   **Sub-Phase 3.1:** Long-Running Queries/Transactions (Dynamic Profiling - Area 2).
    *   **Sub-Phase 3.2:** Inefficient Data Access Patterns (Dynamic Profiling, if still indicated - Area 4).
    *   **Sub-Phase 3.3:** High Application Load (Area 3).
    *   **Sub-Phase 3.4:** Connection Pool Misconfiguration (Area 5).
    *   **Sub-Phase 3.5:** Network Latency/Instability (Area 6).
    *   **Sub-Phase 3.6:** Database Server Bottlenecks (Deeper Dynamic Monitoring - Area 7).
4.  **Phase 4: Correlation, Root Cause Determination & Final Recommendations**

**Note:** The detailed methodologies for each of the 7 investigation areas (Connection Leaks, Long-Running Queries, High Load, Inefficient Patterns, Pool Misconfig, Network, DB Bottlenecks) as previously documented remain largely the same but will be executed in this revised order and iterative fashion. Technology Validation findings still apply.

**Next Steps (within PLAN mode):**
1.  Confirm this revised phasing aligns with user expectations.
2.  Re-confirm plan completeness against PLAN mode checklist based on this revised structure.
