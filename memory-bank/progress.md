## Fixes Implemented

[2025-05-04 08:06:19] - Fixed 'System.ArgumentException: An item with the same key has already been added' in LlmApiClient.ClassifyItemsAsync by grouping items by ItemDescription before converting to a dictionary.

[2025-05-07 17:18:55] - ## {{TIMESTAMP}}: TASK_VAN_001 - Debug NullReferenceException in EmailShipment Fixed

- **Files Modified**:
  - `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs`: Verified
- **Key Changes**:
  - Modified line 152 in `EmailShipment` method.
  - Changed `shipment.Invoices.Sum(x => x.TotalsZero)` to `(shipment.Invoices?.Sum(x => x.TotalsZero) ?? 0)` to prevent `NullReferenceException` if `shipment.Invoices` is null.
- **Testing**: Code fix applied. Manual or integration testing required to confirm resolution in runtime environment.
- **Next Steps**: Transition to REFLECT mode.

[2025-05-11 11:56:24] - ## [2025-05-11 07:55:00] - Build Step 1: Full Solution Build (AutoBot-Enterprise.sln)

### Command
```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\MSBuild\Current\Bin\MSBuild.exe" AutoBot-Enterprise.sln /t:Clean,Restore,Rebuild /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
```

### Result
Command execution was not successful. Exit code: 1.
Build failed with 42 errors and 11257 warnings.
Key errors appear in `AutoBot\AutoBotUtilities.csproj` and `InvoiceReaderPipelineTests\InvoiceReaderPipelineTests.csproj` related to incorrect async/await usage (CS1503, CS1061).

### Effect
The solution is not currently buildable. Async refactoring issues in dependencies are preventing a successful build.

### Next Steps
Analyze and fix errors in `AutoBot\AutoBotUtilities.csproj` as it falls under the 'AutoBot1/autobot projects' scope and seems to be the primary source of build-breaking errors related to async changes.
