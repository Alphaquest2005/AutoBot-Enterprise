## Fixes Implemented

[2025-05-07 17:18:55] - ## {{TIMESTAMP}}: TASK_VAN_001 - Debug NullReferenceException in EmailShipment Fixed

- **Files Modified**:
  - `AutoBot/ShipmentUtils.cs`: Verified
- **Key Changes**:
  - Modified line 152 in `EmailShipment` method.
  - Changed `shipment.Invoices.Sum(x => x.TotalsZero)` to `(shipment.Invoices?.Sum(x => x.TotalsZero) ?? 0)` to prevent `NullReferenceException` if `shipment.Invoices` is null.
- **Testing**: Code fix applied. Manual or integration testing required to confirm resolution in runtime environment.
- **Next Steps**: Transition to REFLECT mode.
