# Task Summary: BOM Cleaning &amp; C# Refactoring (2025-04-01)

## Original Task Objective

*   Analyze C# files in the `AutoBot-Enterprise` solution.
*   For files over 300 lines:
    *   Create a new folder named after the original file.
    *   Create a partial class file within the new folder for each method from the original file.
    *   Delete the original large file.
*   Rebuild the solution.
*   Fix any resulting compilation errors.
*   Update `prompt.md` with successful techniques and procedures learned.

## Task History & Issues

1.  **Initial `prompt.md` Corruption:** Attempts to update `prompt.md` failed repeatedly due to file corruption issues:
    *   Presence of Byte Order Mark (BOM) characters (`��`, `﻿`).
    *   Incorrect file encoding (detected as `UTF-16 LE` by VS Code).
    *   Unusual character spacing (e.g., `R   e   f   a   c   t   o   r`).
    *   These issues caused `read_file` (incorrect line counts) and `apply_diff` (match failures) to fail. `write_to_file` also failed initially ("Failed to open diff editor").
2.  **Encoding Investigation & Fix:**
    *   The root cause was identified as VS Code persistently treating/saving `prompt.md` as `UTF-16 LE`, even after the global `files.encoding` setting was changed to `UTF-8`.
    *   The fix involved manually using the **"Save with Encoding"** command via the VS Code status bar for `prompt.md` and selecting `UTF-8`.
    *   `prompt.md` was successfully updated with this information and a robust file editing plan.
3.  **Current Sub-Task: Proactive BOM Cleaning:** Decided to clean potential BOMs from all previously modified files (identified in `prompt.md`'s "Previous Task Log") before proceeding with the main C# refactoring, to prevent similar encoding issues.
4.  **Build Failure:** A build attempt after cleaning several `.csproj` and `.cs` files failed with multiple `MSB4025` errors ("Unexpected end of file... elements are not closed"). This indicates corruption/truncation in:
    *   `WaterNut.Business.Services\WaterNut.Business.Services.csproj` (Error at Line 633)
    *   `WaterNut.Business.Entities\WaterNut.Business.Entities.csproj` (Error at Line 502)
    *   This likely occurred during the `write_to_file` operations intended to clean the BOMs from these large project files.

## Files Cleaned So Far (BOM removed, saved as UTF-8)

*   `prompt.md`
*   `DataLayer\Custom Classes\WaterNutDBEntities.cs`
*   `Core.Common\Core.Common.UI\Core.Common.UI.csproj`
*   `WaterNut.Business.Entities\WaterNut.Business.Entities.csproj` *(Write attempt failed/interrupted, needs retry)*
*   `PdfOcr\pdf-ocr.csproj`
*   `WaterNut.Client.DTO\WaterNut.Client.DTO.csproj`
*   `WaterNut.Client.CompositeEntities\WaterNut.Client.CompositeEntities.csproj`
*   `AsycudaWorld421\AsycudaWorld421.csproj`
*   `WaterNut.Data\WaterNut.Data.csproj`
*   `WaterNut.Client.Contracts\WaterNut.Client.Contracts.csproj`
*   `EmailDownloader\EmailDownloader.csproj`
*   `WaterNut.Client.Services\WaterNut.Client.Services.csproj`

## Current State (At time of interruption)

*   The last action was reading `WaterNut.Business.Services\Services\CoreEntities\xcuda_Supplementary_unitService.cs` and confirming it contained a BOM.
*   The immediate next step was intended to be writing the cleaned version of this file back using `write_to_file`.

## Plan for Resumption

1.  **Retry Failed Write:** Retry the `write_to_file` operation for `WaterNut.Business.Entities\WaterNut.Business.Entities.csproj` (Cleaned BOM, Line Count: 2806).
2.  **Continue Cleaning:** Proceed with cleaning the BOM from `WaterNut.Business.Services\Services\CoreEntities\xcuda_Supplementary_unitService.cs` (Line Count: 1311).
3.  **Complete Cleaning:** Continue iterating through the remaining files listed in `prompt.md` (lines 161-190), reading each, removing the BOM if present, and writing the full, cleaned content back using `write_to_file` with the correct line count.
4.  **Fix Corrupted Project Files:**
    *   Read `WaterNut.Business.Services.csproj`.
    *   Read `WaterNut.Business.Entities.csproj`.
    *   Analyze the content of both files, likely near the line numbers indicated in the build errors (633 and 502 respectively), to identify the missing closing tags (`</ItemGroup>`, `</Project>`).
    *   Use `write_to_file` to save the *complete* and *corrected* XML content for each file, ensuring all tags are properly closed.
5.  **Verify Build:** Execute the build command again (`msbuild /t:Clean /t:Rebuild ...`) to confirm all `MSB4025` errors (and potentially others caused by BOMs) are resolved.
6.  **Proceed with Original Task:** Once the build is clean, resume the main C# refactoring task: identify files > 300 lines, split methods into partial classes, etc.
