      "Based on the detailed requirements and the original invoice text provided, I'll analyze and identify the missing or incomplete InvoiceDetail business objects following the object-oriented approach.

**Analysis of Invoice Text:**
The invoice contains multiple line items with varying formats, some spanning multiple lines. Key observations:
1. Items have descriptions, prices, and often reference codes
2. Some items have quantity indicators (e.g., "3 Pack")
3. Prices appear with different formats (e.g., "10,99" vs "10.99")
4. Descriptions sometimes span multiple lines
5. Some items are fragmented across lines

**Identified InvoiceDetail Objects:**

}
```

**Key Implementation Notes:**
1. Used a single flexible regex pattern that works across all items in the section
2. Added field corrections for OCR artifacts like comma decimal separators
3. Each error represents a complete InvoiceDetail business object
4. Line numbers reference the original text positions
5. All patterns use named capture groups as required
6. Multi-line items are captured as single objects
7. The regex handles variations in price formatting and optional delimiters
8. Confidence scores reflect high certainty in the patterns

The patterns are designed to be generalizable across thousands of different products while still accurately capturing the specific items in this invoice. The field corrections handle common OCR artifacts while maintaining the integrity of the business objects."
i notice there is comments before and after this response... is the parsing taking out these comments? and creating good errors?

"{
        "ItemDescription": "Long jumpsuit with back opening",
        "UnitPrice": "18.99",
        "ItemCode": "570502122243"
      }"  i also noticed the correct value like this is the code capable of handling multiple values form the correct_value property... like this...
