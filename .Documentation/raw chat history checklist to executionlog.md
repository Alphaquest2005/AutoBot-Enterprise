the llm has a planning phase before it initates an action after reading the prompt. 2 things 1 need to devalue the initial user objective... let me explain... from a implementation or job to be done perspective the initial user goal is the ultimate goal that drives all that you do... however from a operational perspective the inital user objective is really the last thing to be done... do you understand? if, You roo must be functional and working first to achieve the user goal second...
